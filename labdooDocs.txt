What is labdoo?
About Project Labdoo
Labdoo is a social network that is designed from the ground up to serve a social cause. We like to call it an aid social network because the goal is not to make money, but rather to serve a social cause. As such, Labdoo has several properties:
It is non-profit
It is collaborative
It is fully distributed
The code that runs the social network is open and free (GPLv3)
Anyone can participate
It is designed to run without incurring additional CO2 emissions
It requires no funding to run (economic recessions proof)
It is free from any type of advertisement
As indicated, the code that runs Labdoo is freely available. In fact, you can install an instance of the Labdoo social network in your local computer if you want; you can copy the code, modify it, and improve it. You can also use portions of the code to create your own social network if you want to serve other social causes. The code is available from https://github.com/Labdoo(link is external).
This document provides a description of the features implemented by the Labdoo social network.


What is the core of labdoo (five basic objects)?
At its core, the Labdoo social network is based around five types of objects: labdooers, dootronics, dootrips, edoovillages and hubs.
Labdooers: Labdoo users.
Dootronics: Labdoo objects. The actual devices (objects) such as laptops, tablets, etc. that get loaded with education applications and deployed in needy schools.
Dootrips: Labdoo trips. CO2-neutral transportation means used to carry laptops from one location to another. Examples of dootrips are trips carried out by tourists, NGO volunteers (doctors and engineers without borders, humanitarian personnel, etc.), international students, employees of international corporations, etc.
Edoovillages: Schools who receive dootronics such as laptops or tablets loaded with education software.
Hubs: while everyone can participate (from home, from school, from work, etc.), labdooers find commonly useful to organize themselves locally as groups of volunteers. A hub is just that, a group of labdooers located in a given region that get together to carry out Labdoo tasks.



Which are the types of labdoo users?
Anonymous user, Authenticated user, hub manager, edoovillage manager, newsletter manager, wiki writer, team manager, superhub manager
Labdoo users interface with the Labdoo platform by using their own account. If you have not created an account yet and would like to be part of Project Labdoo to help spread education around the globe, please go to the registration page and fill in the fields to create your own account.
Once you have created your own account and logged into the Labdoo system, you will be able to perform tasks such as tagging a laptop, registering a new trip (we call it a 'dootrip'), communicating with other labdooers, or write comments to the various team walls, among many other tasks. The types of tasks you are capable of doing depend on the role your user is given. The following lists the various types of roles a user can have and the tasks allowed for each role:
Anonymous user: corresponds to users who visit labdoo.org without logging into an account. These users can only visualize data (dootronics, dootrips, schools, hubs) but cannot create any object (like tagging a dootronic). These users cannot see any user information either.
Can do: visualize all objects.
Authenticated user: corresponds to the very basic labdoo user role. This is the role that a labdooer receives by default when registering for the first time to the system. This type of account allows users to perform all the base functions such as tagging laptops or registering a dootrip.
Can do: anonymous user plus tag dootronics, create dootrips, register to teams, post conversations and tasks to teams.
Hub manager: provides additional functions to manage hubs, including editing your own hub information, assigning new managers to your hub, or uploading pictures to your hub photo album. Most often when this role is assigned, the user is also assigned the edoovillage manager role so that the hub manager can also create and assign new edoovillages to the hub account.
Can do: authenticated user plus manage hub, upload photos to your hub album, create edoovillages, configure automatic hub notification triggers.
Edoovillage manager: provides additional functions to manage edoovillages, including creating and editing edoovillages, assigning other editors to edoovillages, or uploading pictures to edoovillages photo albums.
Can do: authenticated user plus manage edoovillage, upload photos to a edoovillage album.
Newsletter manager: provides additional functions to manage, edit, and publish newsletters issues.
Can do: authenticated user plus create, edit, issue and manage newsletters.
Wiki writer: provides additional functions to write new wiki documents. This role can create new wiki pages, edit existing ones, and publish or unpublish them.
Can do: authenticated user plus create, edit, and manage wiki entries.
Team manager: provides additional functions to manage Labdoo teams, including creating new Labdoo teams, managing the users part of a team or assigning team management roles to other users.
Can do: authenticated user plus create, edit, and manage Labdoo teams.
Superhub manager: provides additional functions to create new hubs and help manage larger Labdoo regions englobing multiple hubs.
Can do: authenticated user plus create hubs, create and edit superhub pages, manage regional contact pages, assign roles to users, rights to edit any laptop.


How do I manage my roles?
You can check the current roles assigned to your user by going to 'My account' and then clicking the tab 'My roles'.
As mentioned in the previous section, when you create your user for the first time, you are assigned by default the role of "authenticated user". If you need additional roles assigned to your user (e.g., if you want to become an "edoovillage manager" to create your own edoovillages or if you want to become a "Wiki writer" to write books like the one you are reading right now), please contact the Labdoo global team at contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail).


How role delegation works?
Superhub managers have the capability to assign certain roles to users. This helps make the platform more sustainable as managers can distribute tasks by delegating roles to other. For instance, a superhub user can assign the role of "edoovillage manager" to a user so that the new edoovillage manager can help manage a new edoovillage project.
If you are assigned the role of superhub, you can assign new roles to other users as followed (make sure you are logged in first):
Go to the person's user account page (a user account page can be accessed via the URL https://platform.labdoo.org/users/$USERNAME, where $USERNAME is the user's name)
You will see a tab "Roles", click on it.
In the "Roles" page, you can assign or remove roles to that user.


How do I find or contact other labdoo users?
Sometimes you may need to send a message to another Labdoo user to help coordinate some task but you don't have his/her email address. Or you may simply need to find how a user is connected with a specific dootronic, school or hub. In this case, you can use the Labdoo platform to reach out to that user as follows:
First make sure you are logged in to your Labdoo account, otherwise you will not be able to connect with other users.
All the Labdoo objects (dootronics, dootrips, edoovillages and hubs) are associated with users through a variety of fields. For instance, let's say that you want to contact a user who is the manager of a dootronic (for instance: https://www.labdoo.org/content/000004446). Go to that dootronic page and under the field "Manager" you will see the user name of the person managing that dootronic (once again, make sure you are logged in otherwise you will not see this field.). Click on that user name. This will take you to this user's profile page.
Alternatively, you can also find Labdoo users by using the 'Labdooers Dashboard'. Using this dashboard, you can find other users based on country, location, or their username, among other options. To learn how to use the 'Labdooers Dashboard' to find another user, please read this wiki page.
Once you are in the user's profile page, click on the tab "Contact", fill in the form and click on "Send message". This will send a message to that user's email account. The user receiving your message will be able to reply to you also via your Labdoo contact page. Alternatively, you can also check that user's contribution to the Labdoo platform by clicking on the tab "Global contributions" or know about the user's profile by clicking on the "View" tab.


How can I see my global contribution?
Go to your account page by clicking on the "My account" link you will find on any Labdoo page (make sure you are logged in). Then click on "Global contributions". This will take you to a page summarizing all the global contributions you have made using the Labdoo platform, including the amount of CO2 savings derived from your contributions. For each of your contributed items, you will also find links to the corresponding dashboards.


What are dootronics/your devices?
At Labdoo, we use the word dootronics (as in labdoo electronics) to refer to any computer device that can be used for education purposes. A dootronic is therefore any laptop, tablet, ebook or computer device in general that can be loaded with education software and sustainably transported to a needy school. Our current minimum hardware requirement for a donated laptop is Core2 / Duak Core CPU with at least 1 GB (better 2 GB) of RAM.
Dootronics within the Labdoo social network are tracked using a unique tag called the Labdoo ID. A Labdoo ID consists of a unique 9 digit number and a unique QR code. The QR code points to the dootronic URL and provides the functions of traceability and transparency, allowing donors and participants to know the status of their contributed dootronic.
Dootronics follow a set of stages from the time they are introduced into the Labdoo system, through the time they are delivered to a school, and to their final recycling stage in which the laptop is disassembled into reusable parts. These stages allow participants to organize each task around each dootronic in an orderly and transparent manner.
The possible stages a dootronic can go through are:
S0: Tagged with a Labdoo ID
S1: Donated, waiting to pass quality assurance
S2: Passed quality assurance
S3: Assigned to an edoovillage, waiting to be shipped
S4: Deployed and being used
S5: Waiting to be recycled
S6: Recycled
S7: (Deployed in a school library) Checked out
S8: (Deployed in a school library) Available
S9: Deployed but not working
T1: In transit going to an edoovillage
T2: In transit going to a recycling factory
L1: Dootronic was lost


Which operations can I do on a laptop?
There are two main operations you can do on a laptop: you can "tag" it or you can "update" it. Each of these two operations are described next.
Tagging a laptop:
To tag a laptop, click on the "Dootronics" menu that you will find on the top of this page and then click on the option "Tag it!". (Make sure you are logged into your Labdoo account to be able to access this page). Fill in the form with as much information about the laptop as you can, and click on "Save". If you are tagging the laptop on behalf of someone else, you can fill in the field "Additional notification emails" with that person's email address so that he/she can get email updates every time the laptop changes its state as it makes its progress to a destination school.
After saving the form, it is very important to click on the link "Print tags", this will bring up a new screen with the tags. Print the tags and don't forget to attach them to the laptop to make sure the laptop can be properly traced as it makes progress to a needy school.
Note: printing multiple tags. If you need to print multiple tags, you can generate a URL as shown in this note: https://platform.labdoo.org/comment/1992#comment-1992
Updating a laptop:
To update the state of the laptop, go to that laptop page and click on "Edit". Update the "Status" field and click on "Save". Remember that to go to a laptop page, you can use the URL: https://platform.labdoo.org/laptop/LABDOO_ID. For instance, to go to laptop 000002280, use this URL https://platform.labdoo.org/laptop/000002280.
(Optional) If you receive your dootronics from a donor like an organization or a company and would like to remember which laptops were donated by which groups of donors, you can follow the suggestion explained in this page.


Laptop status updates
The laptop surely will need to be transported to different locations in the donation journey from the initial laptop donation until reaching the laptop recipient school.
If the laptop is transporting from one location to another location, it is very important to keep the laptop's location current. Below is the instruction on how to update the laptop location.
1. Go to the dootronics dashboard: ['Dootronics' → 'View'] https://www.labdoo.org/ca/content/dootronics-dashboard
2. In the "Free-Text Search" field, put the 9-digit number of the laptop you want to give to the sanitation hub. This will automatically update the table showing only the relevant dootronic.
3. Click on this dootronic.
4. Click on the 'Edit' button. Make sure you are logged into your account Labdoo, otherwise you will not see the button 'Edit'.
Transporting the laptop from one hub location to another hub
5. Change the "Manager" with the new Labdoo user name who is in charge of the transported hub.
6. In the "Source hub" field, click on the button "Add another item" and add the name of the sanitation hub. Make sure that both your dropping point hub and the recipient sanitation hub are in the "Source hub" field so that the laptop appears in the inventory of both hubs.
7. Repeat all the above steps for each of the laptops that you want to give to a sanitation hub.
Transporting the laptop from hub to an edoovillage
5. Change the "Status" to "S3: Assigned to an edoovillage and waiting to be shipped"
6. In the "Edoovillage destination" field, type in the school name which the laptop is assigned to.
7. Repeat all the above steps for each of the laptops that you want to give to that edoovillage.
8. After transferring the laptop to a traveler, change the "Status" to "T1:In transit, going to an edoovillage"


How can I control dootronics/devices/laptops?
Dootronics provide the features of revision control and cloning to help you efficiently manage them. Here is what these features do:
Revision control. This feature allows you to keep a complete record of all the modifications made on a dootronic. This has two purposes: (1) it allows everyone to know the history of that laptop (what states it has gone through, which places it has been, etc.) and (2) it allows you to undo any changes that were introduced by mistake.
Cloning. This feature allows you to create a copy of the dootronic. This is useful to help you save time when you are tagging multiple laptops that have identical specifications.


How to allow other users to manage dootronics/laptops?
Often we need to allow other users to edit a dootronic that we are managing, so they can help update the status of the dootronic as it makes progress to a school. To allow another user to edit a dootronic that we manage, do as follows:
Go to the dootronic page and click on the "Edit" tab.
Click on the "Additional information" tab.
Fill in the field "Additional editors" with the user name of the person that you want to give edit rights on this dootronic. Click on the "Save" button at the end and you are done.


Who can edit dootronics/laptops?
Any of the following conditions will allow a user to edit a dootronic:
The 'Manager' field in the dootronic is assigned to the user.
The laptop was originally tagged under the user's account.
The user is in the list of 'Additional editors' of the dootronic.
The user is managing a hub that's part of the 'Source hub' list of the dootronic.
The user is managing the edoovillage assigned to the dootronic under its field 'Edoovillage destination' (only for states S3 or above).
If you need to edit the status of a dootronic but do not satisfy any of the above conditions, please contact labdoo at contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail).


Why updating dootronics/laptops is important?
Labdoo is a humanitarian project, its goal is to help spread education as much as possible by delivering laptops loaded with educational content. To do so, it relies on contributions made by many people around the world, both in terms of physical laptops donated and a very large number of collective hours dedicated by many volunteers (people who collect unused laptops, sanitize them, travel with them or simply tell the Labdoo story). It is really important that such generous contributions be matched with a platform that is accurate and reflects the most up to date information because all the people that are involved in each mini-mission deserve to know the latest news about that effort and because without updated information it's difficult to make efficient decisions.
So how do we keep the information in the Labdoo platform most up-to-date to ensure transparency and agility? The answer is: via your frequent updates. For instance, every time a laptop is delivered at a school, the database needs to be updated (by both uploading new pictures and changing the state to "S4: Deployed and being used") as soon as possible so that donors and all volunteers that were part of that mini-mission get to know of the success of their work. But not only that, every time a new action is performed that involves a change in the state of any of the Labdoo objects (dootronics, dootrips, edoovillages, or hubs) it is very important that we update such information inside the Labdoo platform as soon as possible so as to keep the system most up-to-date.


How can I find dootronics/laptops?
Sometimes it is useful to attach a keyword or tag to a dootronic so that it's easy for you to find that dootronic. For instance, imagine that you are receiving 4 dootronic contributions from an organization named "Cool Organization" and would like to make it easy for you to find them all in one shot. You can achieve this with just two simple steps:
When you tag a laptop, under the field "Additional Information" => "Additional notes", type the word "Contribution made by 'Cool Organization'" or something similar (in your own language). Do this for all dootronics contributed by the 'Cool Organization'.
When doing a search, you can now quickly find all the dootronics contributed by the 'Cool Organization' in two different ways:
From the dootronics dashboard typing in the 'Free-Text Search ' field the words 'Cool Organization': https://www.labdoo.org/content/dootronics-dashboard
From the Global Inventory dashboard typing in the 'Search' field the words 'Cool Organization': https://www.labdoo.org/map?type%5B%5D=laptop


How does pick me up work?
1. For Dootronic Contributors:
'Pick me up' is a feature designed to make the process of contributing dootronics (laptops, tablets, etc.) to the Labdoo project as easy as possible. The idea is simple: do you have a dootronic at home that you no longer use but you are so busy that you cannot afford to spend much time on making your contribution? Then follow these very simple steps, which should take only a few minutes of your time:
Tag your contributed dootronic first. You can do this as usual, by clicking on the menu option 'Dootronics' and then the sub-option 'Tag it!'. Then fill in the form providing information about your dootronic and click on 'Save'. This process should take no more than 5 minutes.
Click on the 'Print tags' link. On your newly created dootronic page, you will see an icon and a link 'Print tags', click on it. This will show you the labels and QR codes associated with your dootronic. Print them and attach them to your dootronic. This should take another 5 minutes approximately.
Now click on the 'Pick me up' link and you are done! By clicking on the 'Pick me up' link, you are telling the Labdoo community that your laptop can be picked up from its current location. These 'pick me up' marks are periodically read by Labdoo hub volunteers. You should expect someone from a nearby hub to reach out to you and come pick up your contributed dootronic. This step should take, well, about the time it takes to 'click' on a link... so about one second!
The 'Pick me up' button allows people to contribute their dootronics even if they don't have the time to drop them to their nearest Labdoo hub. Many of us are often busy in our daily activities, but through features like the "pick me up" button, there is now practically no excuse for not contributing your unused laptops and education devices to a needy school :).
As ususal, if you have any feedback on how to improve this and other Labdoo features, share it via the 'Software Development Team'.
2. Pick me up For Hub Labdooers:
If you belong to a hub, you can check the list of dootronics near your area that are marked as 'pick me up' by going to the menu item 'Dootronics' and then clicking on 'View'. This will take you to the dootronics global dashboard. Now click on the button 'Fields' and select the 'Pick me up' option. This will add a column with the status of the 'Pick me up' flag for each dootronic. Click on the top header of that column to order them according to the value of this flag and you will see all the dootronics that are marked with a value of 'yes' for those that are ready to be picked up. Remember that you can also narrow down your search by selecting the country option.
There is also a cool feature to automatically receive email notifications upon any pick up activity near your area.


How do I navigate the menu?
The layout of the Labdoo system is controlled via the main navigation menu (MNM), located at the top of the page. The MNM is present in all the pages and allows users to quickly move to the various resources and tools. An important property of the MNM is that the availability of the various options depends on the role of the user. The more roles a user has, the more options he/she sees in the main navigation menu.
Given their relevance, users can find in the MNM access tabs for each of the five basic objects: dootronics, dootrips, edoovillages, hubs and the user account tabs. In addition, the MNM contains other menu options to help Labdooers inter-operate with the platform, such as visualization dashboards, wiki pages, newsletters, wall-like forums or team and project management operations, among others.


Visualization Dashboards
The design of the Labdoo social network puts special emphasis to providing transparency as one of the key mechanisms to facilitate the health of the system. To enable transparency, a series of dashboards are implemented allowing users to quickly know the status of the various objects (dootronics, dootrips, hubs, edoovillages, etc). These dashboards rely on a variety of mechanisms including geolocation maps, column charts, or dynamically configurable tables, to name a few. To access each dashboard, go to the Main Navigation Menu on the top of each page and click on one of the four Labdoo objects: 'Dootronics', 'Dootrips', 'Edoovillages' or 'Hubs'. Then click on 'View' to see the global dashboard for that type of object.
Optimized Cache to Speed Up Loading Time
The calculations that need to run in order to visualize each dashboard are quite computationally intensive due to the large amount of global data that they need to correlate. In order to speed up the loading of each dashboard and enhance the user experience, the Labdoo engine runs a caching algorithm, which works by computing the dashboards in the background once every hour (this frequency could change in the future but according to our experience this has worked quite well so far). That means that some of these dashboards may not display the latest information some times. Any changes made in the Labdoo system will be reflected in the dashboards at the next turn of the hour. For instance, if you tag a new laptop at time 12:35pm, the dashboards will show the new laptop starting at 1:00pm.


How to search visualization dashboards?
1. Meaning of fields
Table. Meaning of fields in the Labdoo Dashboards
Field	Meaning
Needed	Total number of dootronics demanded by this edoovillage or hub
Remaining	Total number of dootronics demanded by this edoovillage or hub that have still not been delivered
% Completed	Percentage of completion, computed as (Needed - Remaining) / Needed * 100
Delivered	Total number of dootronics delivered to this edoovilage or by this hub
Capacity	Total number of dootronics that can be carried by this dootrip
In transit	Total number of dootronics that are currently in transit traveling to an edoovillage
Transported	Total number of dootronics that have already been transported to an edoovillage
2. Using the 'Free-Text Search' field
Within each visualization dashboard, you will find various tools to help you search, count, geolocate and track the status of any of the four main Labdoo objects (dootronics, dootrips, edoovillages and hubs). These tools include a geolocation map to position the displayed objects, a column chart that provides counting metrics, a search box and a set of drop down menu options to filter your search.
Of special interest is the search box "Free-Text Search", which allows you to search objects across pretty much any of their properties. For instance, you can search objects across Labdoo ID, status, country, assigned edoovillage, etc. One useful feature is that you can do automatically filtered searches by adding a prefix to your query. For instance, let's say that in the dootronics dashboard you want to find the device that has Labdoo ID equal to 000002358. To do so, you can type in the search box id:000002358. Or let's say that you want to find all dootrips that have as destination country Tanzania. To do so, you can go to the dootrips dashboard and type in the search box dstcountry:tanzania. The list of special keywords available for each of the four visualization dashboards is presented in the next table.
Table. List of keywords available to perform filtered searches
Dashboard	Search keys
Dootronics	id, hub, edoovillage, dootripid, status, notes, tagger, manager, emails, country, serialnumber, pickmeup, model, wh

How do I create URL links of specific dashboard views?
Labdoo provides a set of "View Dashboard" for the four main objects (dootronics, dootrips, edoovillages and hubs). These dashboards provide information with finer granularity and are more interactive as data is provided real time. Due to this extra functionality, these dashboards don't provide a way to automatically generate URLs for specific views. However, special 'tricks' have been implemented into these dashboards so that users can manually create such type of URLs. The following method is considered a bit more 'advanced', but if you try a couple of examples, you will see that it is easy to use and it can be very convenient when generating URLs to report your activity.
Let's start with an example. Let's say you want to generate a view of all the edoovillages located in Tanzania that are managed by Labdoo Hub Rhein-Ruhr in Germany located in Morocco (just like in the previous example) using the 'Edoovillage View Dashboard'. For that, go to 'Edoovillages' and click on 'View'. Then, modify the URL as follows:
https://www.labdoo.org/de/content/edoovillages-dashboard?c=tz&h=431
Just like in the previous example, you can now cut and paste this URL and send it to a friend over email or post it in your favorite social network wall.
There are four keywords that you can use in the 'View Dashboards':
'c': The country code.
'h': The hub identifier.
'e': The edoovillage identifier.
'u': The user identifier.
'search:: A metadata field that allows users to filter by keywords matching any field. For instance, to find all the schools in the city of Barcelona, Spain, do https://www.labdoo.org/content/edoovillages-dashboard?search=spain,%20ba.... Or to find all the laptops delivered due to the COVID cause, do https://www.labdoo.org/content/edoovillages-dashboard?search=covid
You can play with any of these. Here is an another example: selecting all the dootronics that are related to user 201, that are currently located in Kenya and that are assigned to edoovillage with identifier 1457 corresponds to this URL:
https://www.labdoo.org/content/dootronics-dashboard?u=201&c=ke&e=1457
Notice that this technique is applicable to any of the four 'View Dashboards': dootronics, dootrips, edoovillages and hubs.


How does the search dashboard works?
The purpose of the Labdooers Dashboard is to help Labdoo users/volunteers (Labdooers) find and communicate with other Labdooers. You can have access to the Labdooers Dashboard by clicking on the "Explore" pull-down menu on the top of each page and then selecting the option "Labdooers". This will bring you to the Labdooers dashboard.
There are two different ways to search Labdooers' information:
Method 1 - Using text search
You can find a list of Labdooers and their information by entering "City", "Country" or "username". You can fill in more than one field at the same time to narrow your search.
After clicking on "Apply", a list of Labdooers who qualify the search condition will be listed down below.
Method 2 - Using map location search
You can also click on the small map provided on top of the page to find users according to location (e.g., users near your or near some hub or edoovillage). A red indicator will appear on the map. The "Latitude" and "Longitude" will also get filled once the indicator is placed. You can move the indicator and the "Latitude/Longitude" will be updated accordingly.
After the indicator is placed on its desired location, you also need to fill the "Distance" field and provide a search range. Once the location and distance are filled, a list of Labdooers who match the search parameters will be listed down below.


What are labdoo teams?
Labdoo provides a communication tool to help labdooers manage their own projects and activities in collaboration with other labdooers. We call this feature "Labdoo Teams". Each team organizes around a theme or topic, and users can join a team or several teams depending on their interests.
To access the list of Labdoo Teams, go to the 'Teams' menu located at the top of each page and select the option 'List all teams'. This will take you to this page. You can then click on any of the teams from that page.
Inside each team, you will see on the right column a list of possible actions you can perform. These actions include:
View the wall of that team and engage in existing discussions.
Start a new conversation.
Create a task and assign it to a yourself or some other user in your team.
Create an event in a calendar (e.g., a typical example of event is a laptop sanitation event).
View the calendar of events in that team.
Do searches inside that team.
Subscribe and unsubscribe from that team.
If your Labdoo account has assigned the role of 'team manager', you will be able to configure and manage those teams that you create.
To manage a team that you have created, do as follows:
1. Go to that team's home page. You will see three tabs: 'View', 'Edit' and 'Team'. Click on the tab 'Team'.
2. In that page, you will see various options to help manage your team, as illustrated in the next figure.
 Go to the team's home page and click on the tab 'Team' to access the following management page.
3. For instance, to see the list of users currently in your team, click on 'People'. To add users to your team, click on 'Add people'. You can also assign the role of admin to any of the users in the team, so that user can also have rights to add other users. Notice also that depending on your role, some of the settings may be read-only.


How do I create and manage Labdoo events?
As part of a team, you will be able to create your own community events. Events are locally organized activities which allow Labdooers to get together and perform group activities. Here are examples of events that you may want to create:
When organizing a laptop sanitation workshop to clean up laptops and load them with the educational software.
When organizing an event to collect unused laptops from your local community.
When organizing your own Labdoo Conference (these are normally organized once a year in certain cities of the world).
Be creative, you can create your events for pretty much any activities (from small gatherings to larger workshops or conferences) that require getting people together around the topics of spreading education and make our planet a more sustainable place.
The feature "Labdoo Events" allows you to create and manage your own events within the Labdoo platform. It provides functions such as creating the event, announcing the event to your community, allowing people to register to your event so you can track the head count, manage your events calendars, or sending messages to your registrants to keep them up to date about the event details, among others functions.
To create an event follow the next simple steps:
Click on the 'Teams' menu found on the top of each Labdoo page and select 'List all teams'. This will show you the list of all Labdoo teams. Then select the most suitable team where you want to create your event according to the subject of your event.
Once you are in your selected team page, you will find a set of icons on the right side (note: please make sure first that you are subscribed to this team by clicking on the icon 'Subscribe to this team', as you can only create events for teams that you are subscribed to). Click on the icon 'Start event'. This will open a form to create your event. Enter the 'Title' of your event, a 'Description', the 'Dates' and 'Location' of the event, an optional image (e.g., the event flyer), and select whether you want to automatically announce this event to all members of the team through the option 'Send to all members of this team'.
Under the 'Registration' field, select the option 'Enable event registration' if you would like to enable the registration form. This will allow you to manage labdooers' registration to this event as well as send them event-related email notifications.
Click on 'Save'.
Your event is now created. You can now share it by clicking on the social network buttons that you will find in your event page (for Google+, Facebook, Twitter or any of your favorite platforms) or you can also copy the URL of the new event and share it.
If you enabled the option 'Enable event registration', you will be allowed to manage your event registrations. In that case, your event page will have two extra tabs: 'Manage registrations' and 'Register'.
By clicking on the 'Register' tab, you will be able to register yourself to the event. Other Labdoo users will see this tab to register themselves too. When sharing your event, you need to provide the URL of this event page so that users can register themselves by clicking on this 'Register' tab. Notice that the 'Register' tab is also available to users who don't have a Labdoo account, allowing these users to register to your events using their email address.
By clicking on the 'Manage registrations' tab, you will enter a sub-menu with options to configure your event registrations, to see the current list of registrants and to send the registrants email announcements, among other functions (this tab is only visible to the event manager). All these functions are designed to ensure you run a successful event!



How do I contact managers?
From time to time we need to send a message to all hub and/or edoovillage managers. For instance, when there is an announcement to be made about a new platform feature or a new release of the Labdoo educational software images. This can be done from the special Team called "The Coffee Shop": https://www.labdoo.org/content/coffee-shop/activities
To write a message to reach out to all hub and/or edoovillage managers, do as follows:
Go to the Coffee Shop team: https://www.labdoo.org/content/coffee-shop/activities
Click on "Start conversation"
Write a message just like you do for any other team conversation. At the end of the page, you will now see two check boxes: "Send to all hub managers" and "Send to all edoovillage managers". Select any (or both) of these chech boxes if you want your message to be broadcasted to all hub/edoovillage managers.
Remember that this is a powerful feature as it allows you to instantly send a message to all hub and edoovillage managers, so please use it wisely and make sure your message will be of relevant interest to the managers.



How to share conversations with other users/teams?
Some times you may want to start a conversation within a team but make it also available to other teams. Or you may also want to have a finer control on what users your conversation is shared with. When creating a new conversation, this can be done via the "Sharing options" panel, as shown in the following picture:
If you to don't want to share the message with all the members of the team, uncheck the option "Share with all members of this team".
If you want to share the conversation with other teams, use the field "Share with additional teams".
If you want to share with specific users (even if they are not in the selected team), use the field "Share with additional users".
If you want to share with a person's email address (e.g., someone who does not have a Labdoo account), use the field "Share with additional email addresses".


How do I post a conversation to teams?
To post a message to a team wall, do as follows:
First make sure you have a Labdoo account. If you don't have a Labdoo account, you can create one by going to this link: https://www.labdoo.org/user/register. After you have created your Labdoo account, log in and follow on to the next step.
Go to the list of teams: https://www.labdoo.org/teams
Select the team that you want to post your message to. For instance, if you want to post a message to the Coffee Shop Team, click on the "Coffee Shop" team link.
Click on "Subscribe to this team" and accept the subscription.
Click on "Start conversation". This will take you to a page where you can write your message and post it. Click on "Save", your message is now posted and broadcasted via email to all members of that team. You will also receive via email a copy of your own message. Check from time to time your email and the wall to see if someone follows up with a reply.


What are activity feeds, how can users get a good sense of activities carried out?
So that all users (visitors, logged in users, participants, technology recipients, donors, etc.) can get a good sense of the activities carried out within the Labdoo network, the system provides various types of feeds. These feeds display both real time information of the activities being carried out as well as historical data of all past activities. Activity feeds can also be searched and filtered (for instance, you can specify to only display the activities carried out by you).
The main function of the activities feed is to help improve the transparency of the Labdoo system at all times to preserve the healthy state of the platform.


How can I contribute with making labdoo more accessible?
The more languages we support, the more people will be able to contribute and benefit, enabling a more balanced and sustainable organic growth path. To that end, the Labdoo social network exposes an interface to facilitate the process of translating the same Labdoo system. This allows anyone to participate in the process of helping translate the platform into another language.
The translation system is based on the concept of 'templates'. To translate the totality of the Labdoo platform, two types of templates need to be translated:
Email (.email) templates. Email templates correspond to the automatic email notifications that the Labdoo system sends to users when certain actions happen. For instance, when a laptop is delivered to a school, the user who contributed that laptop receives an automatic email notification in that user's preferred language.
Portable object (.po) templates. This corresponds to the actual sentences and words that appear on the Labdoo social network, in all the visualization dashboards, user interfaces, forms, etc.
If you would like to contribute to the Labdoo project by helping translate the platform to another language, you can do so by following the next instructions.
1. Translation of email (.email) templates.
Go to https://github.com/Labdoo/Labdoo/blob/master/translations/email-files/la...(link is external)
Right click on the button “Raw”, select the option ‘Save link as’ and download the file into your local computer.
Unzip the file using your favorite unzip application. This will extract various files.
For each file extracted, open it using a text editor and translate it to your language.
Save the file using the same file name but changing its suffix to reflect the language you are translating to. For instance, if you are translating to Japanese the file ‘dootrip_added_body-en.email’, rename the translated file to ‘dootrip_added_body-japanese.email’.
Repeat the steps above for all extracted files.
2. Translation of portable object (.po) templates.
Go to https://github.com/Labdoo/Labdoo/blob/master/translations/po-files/templ...(link is external)
Right click on the button “Raw”, select the option ‘Save link as’ and download the file into your local computer.
Unzip the file using your favorite unzip application. This will extract various files.
For each file extracted, open it using a text editor. To translate the file, search for all occurrences of the keyword ‘msgstr “”’ and include into the quote “” the translation of the English words found in the field ‘msgid’.
Save the file using the same file name but changing its suffix to reflect the language you are translating to. For instance, if you are translating to Japanese the file ‘fields-en.po’, rename the translated file to ‘fields-japanese.po’.
Repeat the steps above for all extracted files.
Where to send the translated files
Once you are done with your translations, send the translated files to the email address project-labdoo@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail) using as subject ‘Labdoo.org translation files’.
What about translating documents in the wiki?
The above two types of translations (.po and .email files) will allow you to translate the totality of the Labdoo platform except for the content found in the wiki system. This is because Laboo wiki content has its own online translation mechanism to allow wiki editors to work on their own, providing more flexibility and helping optimize the overall wiki book writing and translation workflow. If you want to translate a wiki page or book, please directly refer to the translation section of the wiki chapter.


What and how to use the documentation / wiki pages?
The Labdoo platform allows users to create their own wiki pages. To do so, your user will need to have the role of "book writer". If you don't have this role assigned and would like to write wiki pages, please email contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail). (You can check the current roles assigned to your user by going to 'My account' and then clicking the tab 'My roles'.)
The Labdoo platform relies on the concept of wiki pages to allow users share knowledge and best practices. Here are some of the most common situations in which you will want to create a wiki page:
A manual to describe a certain process. For instance, the manual on how to sanitize a laptop or the manual on how to use the Labdoo social network (such as this section) are written using wiki pages.
A guide to describe a certain education software application. For instance, you can use wiki pages to describe an application within the Edubuntu software package.
A page within the Labdoo social network that requires some level of description detail. For instance, the "About Labdoo" page or the "Labdoo Values" pages are written using this wiki system.
Translations of any existing wiki pages. One of the goals of Labdoo is to be as globally inclusive as possible. That entails providing content in as many languages as possible. Therefore, another situation in which you will want to create a wiki page is the need to translate an existing wiki page or book.
To create a wiki page, follow the next steps:
Click on the "Wiki" tab and select "Add new content".
In the wiki form, fill in the following sections:
Title. If the page you are creating is the first page of a book, this field corresponds to the book title. If the page is a section within a book, this field corresponds to the section title.
Language. Choose the language you are using to write this wiki page.
Is this page part of an original book. In this field, if you are translating a page from another original wiki page, select "It's a translation". Otherwise, select "It's the original". If you select "It's a translation", a new field will pop up asking for the original book. In this field, select the book you are translating the wiki page from.
Body. Write here the actual body of your wiki page. The wiki system supports a simplified set of HTML tags which allows writers to format their text (e.g., bold, italic, bullet points, etc.). For a description of these metatags, see the section Special HTML tags.
Book outline. Under the "Book" field, if this is a new book, select "create a new book". Otherwise, if your new page corresponds to a section or chapter of a book, select the book it belongs to from the list. In this latter case, in the field "Parent item" select the existing parent section to which you want to attach the new page as a child page.


Special wiki HTML tags
The body section of a wiki page allows writers to use a simplified form of HTML tags to help them format their content. While the page 'Compose tips' (a link to this page is provided at the bottom of the "body" field in each wiki form) provides a detail description of each of the HTML tags supported by the Labdoo wiki system, in this section we provide additional information for some of the tags that are a bit more advanced.
Inserting images
As explained in the 'Compose tips', you can insert an image using the <img> tag. For instance, the following tag:
<img src="/profiles/labdoo/files/pictures/laptop.png" width="50"/>
To upload the actual image, follow the next steps:
Click on "My account" to go to your account.
Click on the "Manage files" tab. (If you don't see this tab, it's because you don't have enough permissions. Send an email to contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail) to get your permissions upgraded.)
You will see a file system directory tree. Next, make sure to select the folder 'content', as this is the folder used to upload images for wiki content. Please notice that if you select a folder outside 'content', your image may not correctly display in future releases of the Labdoo platform. As an option, you can also create a new directory inside 'content' by clicking on the "Directory" tab and select that new folder as the place where you upload your image. A general rule of thumb is that each new wiki book should have its own directory under the folder 'content'.
Click on "Upload" to complete the uploading of your image.
Double click on the image you just uploaded. This will take you to the new image page on a new browser page. You can now copy the URL of this image page from your browser. Use this URL in the "src=" field of your <img> tag.
If you want to insert an image into your text, please follow the following format:
Add a <hr> tag before and after your image to display a separating line.
Add a 'Figure' caption inside <em> tags on top of the image.
Add both the figure caption and the figure itself inside a table <table> center aligned.
Here is an example:
<hr/>
<table align="center">
<tr><td>
<em> Figure. This is the Labdoo logo.</em>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<img src="/profiles/labdoo/files/pictures/laptop.png" width="50"/>
</td></tr>
</table>
<hr/>
You may insert videos using the following simple tag:
For example:
[video:https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/watch?v=Gpo-7GjFydw]



Internal Links
If you need to create a link to a page that lives inside www.labdoo.org (for instance, a link to another wiki page), it's important to use relative paths starting with the string ../. For instance, if you want to create a link to this wiki page, follow this example:
<a href="../content/creating-internal-links">An example link to this wiki page</a>
Which generates this link:
An example link to this wiki page
Using the string ../ in front of your internal links serves two goals:
It generates a relative path, so that the link can be used independent of the URL base path (this is helpful for instance in development mode or when cloning the wiki to other hosts).
It allows the link to work regardless of the language selected by the user. (You can test this feature by changing the language of this page and then clicking on the link, it should take you to this same page while preserving the selected language.)


How do I create wiki translations?
The goal of Labdoo is to break barriers so that education can reach out to all the regions of the world. A key to overcoming these barriers is the capability to write documents not just in one language but in as many as possible. To that end, the Labdoo wiki system provides a few simple functions facilitating the translation of any wiki doc into any other language. If you find a relevant wiki page or book that is not available in your language, we encourage you to take action and start a translation on your own.
Here are the steps to translate a wiki page or book:
Go to 'Wiki' tab and select 'Add new content'. (Your account needs to have the role 'book writer' in order for this link to be activated. If you don't have that role enabled, send an email to contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail) soliciting that role. You can check the list of roles assigned to your account by going to 'My account' and then clicking the tab 'My roles'.)
Enter the translated title of the wiki page or book you are translating.
In the field 'Language', select the language you are translating to. If your language does not show up in the list, send an email to contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail) so that it can be added.
Select the option 'It's a translation'.
In the field 'Original book', select the original page or book that you are translating.
In the 'body' field, translate the original body. It may simplify here to copy and paste the 'body' field of the original page into this field because this way you will be able to re-utilize all the HTML tags. To do so, on a separate browser tab, go to the original source page that you are translating, click on 'Edit' (as a wiki editor, you will have access to the 'Edit' tab), copy the 'body' field from there and paste it into your translated 'body' field. You can then exchange the words and sentences from the source language to the target language without altering the HTML tags.
Just like any other book, in the field 'Book', select 'Create a new book' if this is the first page you are translating, or select the title of the translation book if otherwise.
Select also the 'Parent item' appropriately.



How do I publish/unpublish from the wiki?
It is important to not make a wiki page publicly available until its text has been carefully proofread and corrected from any typos and grammatical mistakes. This is to ensure that all content abides to a minimum standard of quality.
To accomplish this, each wiki page has a tag on its top called 'Publish/Unpublish' (this feature is only available to users who have the 'book writer' role enabled) that the wiki writer can use to control whether that page is publicly visible or not. Please use this feature to control when your page should be published. Notice also that only users with the 'book writer' role will be able to see unpublished pages, to all other users such pages are not visible nor searchable.


How do I allow other users to edit a wiki page?
Because the wiki is designed to be a collaborative tool, often we need to allow other users access to edit wiki pages. There are two methods to allow other users to edit wiki pages:
Coarse grained access to edit wiki pages. If you are a superhub manager, you can use the 'Role Delegation' method to give a user the right to edit any wiki page. This method is explained under the section Role Delegation of this Manual. Please notice that using this method, if you assign the role 'wiki writer' to a user, then this user will be able to edit all the wiki pages. Use this coarser grain method with care and only to assign edit rights to users who feel comfortable editing wiki pages.
Fine grained access to edit wiki pages. Some times we only want to grant a user access to edit a few pages (not all the wiki pages). You can achieve this by going to that specific wiki page, clicking on the 'Edit' tab, and then adding the user we want to grant edit rights to the field 'Grant edit rights' (See picture below). Notice that this will give the user access to edit only that wiki page and all of its children wiki pages.


How are wiki changes controlled/revised?
The Labdoo wiki system provides revision control on each of the wiki pages. Every time a user modifies a wiki page, the changes are tracked. This allows for instance to roll back changes that were introduced by mistake or to see when certain changes were introduced.
To use this feature, click on the 'Revisions' tab that you will find on the top of each wiki page. (This feature is only available to users who have the 'book writer' role enabled.)


Can I print or export wiki content?
Every wiki page has at its bottom a link labeled 'Printer-friendly version' which viewers can use to generate a printer friendly version of that page. (To test it, click on the same link you will find at the bottom of this page.) To print the complete book instead of a single page, go to the first page of the book and click on its 'Printer-friendly version' link, it will take you to a page containing the whole book.
This feature can also be used to export the book into a PDF file. For that, when printing the book using your browser printing option, select the option to save it as a PDF. (This option will depend on the browser you are using.)


Can I download/access the wiki offline?
To download a wiki so that it can be accessed offline, you can use openly available tools that allow you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory. One tool that people have successfully used to download the Labdoo Wiki is called HTTrack, which is available for free (under GPL, libre/free software license) from http://www.httrack.com/(link is external).
This type of tools come very handy for instance when you want to include a certain wiki book into a laptop that you are going to bring to a school that may have limited Internet access. If you have any questions on how to use these tools, you can ask around in the Quality Assurance team wall.

Wiki best practices
While there is quite a bit of flexibility when writing your own wiki books, it is important to follow certain best practice rules to ensure that the content provided within the Labdoo platform is of good quality. As a wiki writer, please follow the next recommendations:
Keep it simple. You have the option to use HTML markup tags, but it is recommended to only use them if you really need them. 
Use links with relative paths. Please check this wiki entry on how links should be created.
Ensure HTML tags are correctly written. For instance: <em>text here</em>. If your tag does not include any object inside (such as the new line tag <br> or the horizontal line tag <hr>), then you have two options: you can use either <br></br> (without any object between the clauses) or the more compact version <br/>. This first best practice is specially important because the Labdoo system provides automatic back ups of all the wiki content which needs to parse all the wiki pages, and if the tags are not correctly set up, the parsing process can break.
As a book writer, you have enough user permissions to click on the "Edit" tab found on the top of each of the pages in this book (make sure you are logged in to see the "Edit" tab), which will allow you to see how each field was filled in.
Capitalize titles. For instance, the title of this page is "Best Practices", not "best practices" and not "Best practices". This helps keep consistency.
Consistency. Please keep consistency across your document. This will make your text more pleasant to readers.
Spell check and proof read your text. It is very recommended that you have some one else read the text and help you correct it, if possible someone who is good at spelling and grammar. For instance, try to have in your team or community a volunteer that can help you with this task.
Save your text often. 


How to structure wiki content?
The general structure of the Labdoo wiki system is similar to other standard wiki systems (such as the Wikipedia) and hence it is fairly free style. That means that there is no need to have a lot of synchronization on what types of documents are created. If you believe that a certain article or document belongs to the Labdoo wiki system, then in general you can go ahead and create it. The wiki is an open system and your work will be subject to peer reviewing by other Labdooers so that if the new document is inappropriate to the subjects of interest in the Labdoo platform, then you will be given instructions on how to edit the content. As in any open wiki system, inappropriate content can be unpublished at any time, to ensure the wiki abides to certain standards of quality and relevancy.
Besides the above general 'free style' principle, the wiki does have a few categories of documents that are considered core to the Labdoo platform and standard for all available languages. When writing a new document, one needs to first consider if the new page belongs to any of these categories and structure the document accordingly, ensuring that there is no overlapping and that the new text follows a smooth reading experience with respect to the core documents. Here is the list of core documents/categories:
The Labdoo Social Network - How It Works. The user manual describing how the Labdoo system works from a user perspective. This page belongs to it. [link]
Values, Philosophy and Principles of the Labdoo Project. A description of the principles of the Labdoo project, including the goals and the approach taken by the platform. [link]
dootronic Sanitation Guide. This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to sanitize devices that can be used for education purposes. [link]
Labdoo Toolkit. The 'Labdoo Toolkit' includes documents that are needed to carry out Labdoo activities, including request forms, logos and drawings that you can use to run your own local campaigns, email templates to simplify the process of replying to solicitors, dootripper letters that can be used when traveling, etc. [link]
Education Applications. In this category, wiki writers provide descriptions of the education applications that are part of the devices deployed by Labdoo in schools. This can include descriptions of the offline wikipedia, of the applications found in the Edubuntu package, or in general of any of the many education applications that dootronics come preloaded with.
The general principle to add content to the wiki system is as follows: if the subject of the new wiki page belongs to any of the above core categories, then consider adding the new page as part of the above documents; otherwise, you can create a new wiki book.


Can I reorder wiki pages?
Wiki books have multiple wiki pages, each page being a section inside the book. When you create or manage a wiki book, you will most likely need to rearrange the order in which each of these sections is presented. For instance, if you have a book consisting of three wiki pages called "Introduction", "Initial Steps", "Advanced Steps", it is logical that you would like to order these sections in the book by presenting first the section "Introduction", then the section "Initial Steps" and lastly the section "Advanced Steps".
To rearrange the order of pages in a wiki book, do the following:
Go to the book page you want to rearrange. For instance, go to the book "Values, Philosophy and Principles of the Labdoo Project". Then click on where it says "Reorder this book's hierarchy" on the upper right part of the page.
This will present you the list of page subtitles in the book. On the left side of each page subtitle, you will see a small icon with a cross. Click on this icon and you will be able to drag this element up or down the list. This will allow you to reorder each of the elements. In some browsers, if you don't see the small icon with a cross, then you can also rearrange the order of books by using the weights. A lower value on the weight of a page means that that page will be displayed first.
When you are pleased with the reordering, click on the button "Save book pages" at the bottom of the page. Your new page ordering is now saved. You can now click on any of the "view" links to go back to the book.



How do I correct broken links?
The Labdoo Wiki engine has a module to detect broken links. This module runs in the background automatically from time to time, scanning Labdoo wiki pages and checking for broken links, so you don't have to manually do that by yourself. This means that using this feature is very simple, as described next.
In order to see the list of broken links that are found in wiki pages that you have written, go to "My account" on the upper right corner of any Labdoo page and select the option 'My broken links'. (Please notice that you will only see this option if you are logged into your account and if your account has 'wiki writer' rights.) This will take you to a page under your account with all the broken links that have been detected in wiki pages that you have written. For each broken link that you see in this list, click where it says 'Edit node $NUMBER'. This will take you to that node (in edit mode) where you can directly correct the broken link. If you are a wiki writer, from time to time please do make sure to go to this page and ensure that you have no broken links.
There is also a way to see all the broken links (not just those located in wiki pages that you write, but all the broken links from all the wiki pages) in a centralized list. To see this list, go to the 'Wiki' menu on the top of any Labdoo page and select the option 'All broken links'. (Again, only if you have 'wiki writer' rights you will see this option.) By clicking on this option, you will be taken to a page which gathers the complete list of broken links from all the wiki pages.
A note on broken links error codes. Each broken link comes with its own error code (see figure below for some examples). The most important broken links are those marked with error code 404, which means that the link does not exist ('Page not found'). Please fix all the broken links with error code 404. Other error codes may not need to be fixed. For instance, error code 301 means 'page permanently moved to a new URL', but the link itself is correct, so you don't need to correct any links with error 301.
A note on how pages are scanned. Broken links are found by scanning pages. This happens in two different ways: (1) when a page is saved, the link checker will provide a warning if any of the links are broken, so you can immediately fix it; (2) every hour (at the top of the hour), there is a background process that also checks for broken links. Notice also that when you fix a link, its entry will be immediately removed from the list of broken links.


How can I check the inventory? How does inventory work?
At Labdoo, we all like the joy of seeing our laptops loaded with education software deployed in schools around the globe. But it is also very important that all the devices we deploy can eventually find their way to a recycling factory. The risk of not doing so is the generation of electronic waste in places that don't have the means to recycle technology, which is a potential problem that could defeat the good intentions of our efforts. The bias "deploy versus clean up" goes very similar to the dynamics we often see at a friend's party: we all enjoy more preparing and being part of a party than to clean up the dishes after the party is over. Yet we cannot stress enough the importance of having the capability and will to recycle all electronic devices to help preserve our planet.
To help eliminate potential electronic waste, Labdoo incorporates a tool called Global Inventory Check or GIC (pronounced as in "jeek(s)"). The GIC mechanism works as follows:
Accessing GIC Tables. Each edoovillage project has a table (called the GIC table), in which each row corresponds to a dootronic assigned to that specific edoovillage. The table has two columns: one is for the Labdoo identifier of each dootronic and another one is used to reflect its current status. This table is used to provide an easy way to update the status of all dootronics assigned to an edoovillage.
Updating GIC Tables. Periodically, each project manager needs to do a quick inventory check of the dootronics in his/her edoovillage and update the GIC table according to the latest status of the devices. If a deployed dootronic stops working, its corresponding entry in the GIC table must be marked with the status "[S9] Deployed but not working".
Feedback communication. In order to update the GIC table, edoovillage managers need to be in communication with the corresponding point of contacts in the edoovillage site (the teachers, IT personnel or persons in general who are in charge of maintaining the deployed dootronics.) Through this communication, feedback can be collected to detect when a dootronic that stops working needs to be rescued.
Rescuing dootronics. Once a dootronic is marked with the status "[S9] Deployed but not working", edoovillage managers and labdooers in charge of supporting the edoovillage need to activate a dootrip to rescue the broken dootronic and bring it back either to a hub where it can be fixed or to a proper recycling location if it cannot be repaired. If you or someone knows how to fix the dootronic, there is no need to bring it back to a hub, you can go ahead and fix it too.
A final comment about GICs is that besides using them to help you track broken deployed dootronics, they can generally be used to quickly update all the dootronics assigned to an edoovillage in one shot. Often, updating the status of a dootronic (e.g. from status T1 to status S4) needs to be done on several dootronics that are all associated with the same edoovillage. The GIC table shows you in one page all these dootronics, allowing you to change their status at once in just a few clicks.



What are hubs?
Everybody can be a participant in the Labdoo network by performing actions to help spread education around the globe. When one or more of the participants act together regularly, they can optionally create their own Labdoo Hub. A hub is mainly a group of people that get together from time to time to carry activities such as collecting and sanitizing unused laptops, organizing dootrips, recycling technology, or carrying out outreaching activities, among others. Hubs are flexible in that they do not need to carry out all of these activities, but just the ones that are appropriate to the skills of the people part of it. For instance, some hubs are just dropping points where people can bring their unused laptops which then get transported to other hubs where they get sanitized. Hubs are typically implemented in high schools, at home, in companies, in your local neighbor community, in any type of organized community.
If you want to create you own hub, please write an email to contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail) and we will get back to you with further information on how to proceed.
When your own hub is created, you will receive a kit containing the following:
A hub space inside the Labdoo systems that allows for the management of donated devices, dootrips, edoovillages, etc.
The listing of the hub in the page www.labdoo.org/hubs to help it gain visiblity. Step-by-step instruction to find a hub.
The rights to create new edoovillages.
A web album inside the hub space where pictures of the hub's activities can be uploaded.
The capability to configure additional triggers to notify you when certain activities happen around you (for instance, receiving automatic emails when someone near your area donates a laptop or contributes a dootrip.)
Detailed information about the amount of CO2-emission savings the hub has contributed to planet earth thanks to its Labdoo related activities.
There exist two types of hubs at Labdoo:
Dropping points. These are hubs that their only task is to provide a place where people can bring their unused laptops and tablets. These hubs then hold the laptops until Labdoo volunteers from a sanitation hub come pick them up.
Sanitizing points. These are hubs that perform both the task of collecting laptops (just like the dropping point hubs) and the task of sanitizing them, which consists in cleaning them physically, erasing all its digital content, and installing the Labdoo educational package as explained in this wiki page. While the sanitation point hubs can collect laptops by themselves, they can also pick up laptops from a dropping point if they have one near their area.


What can I do as a hub manager?
As a hub manager, you will have the capability to activate some triggers allowing you to automatically receive notifications upon certain events that might be of interest to your hub operations. To manage your notification triggers, click first on 'My account' to go to your account page. From there, click on the 'Edit profile' tab. This will open your profile configuration page. In that page, scroll down until you see the section 'Hub manager notifications'. In that section, you will be able to select which notification triggers you want to activate and also define your notification area.
Under 'Types of notifications ', select any of the triggers that you want to turn on:
'Upon a dootronic being marked with the 'pick me up' flag': Select this trigger if you want to be notified of dootronics that have been marked with the flag 'Pick me up' near your area.
'Uppon tagging a dootronic': Select this trigger if you want to be notified upon a dootronic being tagged near your area.
'Upon a new user joining Project Labdoo': Select this trigger if you want to be notified upon a new user being registered near your area.
Under 'Notification area', specify the area of the region you would like to receive notifications from. For instance, if you set this value to 50 km, you will receive notifications from activity happening within 50 kms of your home location.
To upload the pictures of your hub activities to your hub photo album, do as follows:
1. Make sure you are logged in to Labdoo.org. (If you are not logged in, go to https://www.labdoo.org/user/login and enter your username and password.)
2. Go to your hub page. To find your hub page, you can go to "My account" (https://www.labdoo.org/user) and then click on the "Global contributions" tab. Then click on the link "[See all contributed hubs]". This will take you to a dashboard from where you can select your hub.
3. Once you are on the hub page, click on "Go to photo album". This will take you to your photo album. Now you can click on "Upload new photos" where you will be able to upload your new photos. Notice that you will only see the option "Upload new photos" if you have sufficient hub managing rights to do so. If you don't see this option, contact the Labdoo team (https://www.labdoo.org/content/contact-labdoo) giving us your username so that we can provide sufficient rights to your account.
If you have any issues uploading your pictures, contact the Labdoo team at https://www.labdoo.org/content/contact-labdoo.
Each hub comes with a semaphore which is displayed on the right side of its dashboard (see Figure below). The semaphore colors have the following meaning:
Green: Open. This is the state indicating the hub is open and operating normally. You can reach out to this hub to either donate unused laptops (in the case that the hub is a dropping point hub) or to ask for sanitized laptops (in the case that the hub is a sanitizing point hub). For an explanation of the types of hubs, see this page.
Orange: Inactive. The hub is temporarily inactive and it cannot accept nor provide any dootronics. A typical reason is that the team operating the hub might be on vacation or temporarily taking a leave of absence. The hub will not be able to respond to donations or requests until it is enabled back into the green state.
Red: Closed. In this state, the hub is permanently closed and a new team of volunteers is needed to resume its operations. This state refers to the case in which the team which was in charge of the hub had to cease operations (for whichever reason). The hub is not removed from the database because for transparency reason it's important to keep its historical records. This hub's operations can be resumed (and its semaphore state set back to green color) if a new team of volunteers in the village or city where the hub is located wants to take over the management of the hub. New volunteers who want to resume operations of a closed (red color) hub can solicit it by writing an email to contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail).
To change the status of your hub's semaphore, click on the 'Edit this hub' link (see Figure) that you will find in your hub's dashboard (make sure you are logged in to see this link) and change the value of the field 'Semaphore'.



What does a hub do when receiving laptops from the citizens?
The following protocol describes the actions that need to be taken by the dropping point hub when receiving laptops from the citizens and when handing laptops to the sanitation hubs.
Laptop management protocol for Labdoo Dropping Point Hubs
When your hub receives a laptop from a donor:
Remember to ask the donor for his/her email address if he/she wishes to receive email updates as the laptops makes progress to a school.
Go to the tagging page ['Dootronics' → 'Tag it!'] https://platform.labdoo.org/node/add/laptop
Fill in all fields under the 'Basic information' tab. Set the status of the laptop to "S1" and set the "Source hub" field to the name of your dropping point hub so that the laptop remains connected to your hub inventory. Upload also a picture of the laptop in the corresponding field.
Fill out the "Additional notification emails" field with the email address that the donor gave you in step 1. You will find this field in the 'Additional information' tab.
Click on the button 'Save' ('Save') at the bottom of the page. At this point the dootronic's page is created, sending also an email to your hub and to the donor's email address that you set in step 4.
Click on the button "Print tags" at the top of the page of your new dootronic. Print the three labels. Cut the three labels and stick them with transparent tape on the laptop: one label goes underneath the laptop, another one goes inside the battery compartment and a third label needs to be attached to the power adapter. Make sure the tape fully covers all these labels and that they are firmly attached to the laptop and the adapter.
When your hub gives a laptop to a sanitation hub.
Go to the dootronics dashboard: ['Dootronics' → 'View'] https://platform.labdoo.org/content/dootronics-dashboard
In the "Free-Text Search" field, put the 9-digit number of the laptop you want to give to the sanitation hub. This will automatically update the table showing only the relevant dootronic. Click on this dootronic.
Click on the 'Edit' button. Make sure you are logged into your account Labdoo, otherwise you will not see the button 'Edit'.
Change the "Manager" and add instead the user name in charge of the sanitation hub.
In the "Source hub" field, click on the button "Add another item" and add the name of the sanitation hub. Make sure that both your dropping point hub and the recipient sanitation hub are in the "Source hub" field so that the laptop appears in the inventory of both hubs.
Repeat all the above steps for each of the laptops that you want to give to a sanitation hub.
Go to the Teams wall : ['Teams' → 'List all teams'] https://platform.labdoo.org/teams. Select your area team and click on the icon "Start Conversation" and post a message to its wall to make public that you have N (number) laptops ready to be picked up. While we encourage that you use the team wall to communicate, if you already know the sanitation hub you want to give your laptops to, you can also communicate with that hub directly via email.
On a regular basis, the first who answers your message will receive the laptops.


What are superhubs?
A hub englobing multiple hubs within the same geographic region is called a superhub. Superhubs add two additional functionalities to the Labdoo system:
They are allowed to create hubs inside their region. This feature helps to decentralize the process of creating hubs enabling a more sustainable growth path and removing possible centralized bottlenecks.
They can have their own site pages. Superhubs can create their own Labdoo pages to help better localize certain regional activities. For instance, they can write an informative page in a specific language to help outreach in the geographic area where the hubs under the superhub reside.


Creating Hubs
Labdoo users who have the "superhub" role assigned are allowed to create new Labdoo hubs. (For information on what a hub is, please refer to the Hubs Section in the 'Values and Principles' wiki book.) The process of creating a new Labdoo hub is as follows:
Initial contact. The group soliciting to create a hub contacts Labdoo. This can be done through different ways, including getting in touch with an existing neighbor hub or by directly emailing contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail). Such request is propagated to the Labdoo superhub in charge of the region where the new hub is to be created.
Explaining what a Labdoo hub is. The superhub explains the potential hub manager candidates how a Labdoo hub works. It is recommended to do such communication using a phone call (can be a regular or Internet-based phone call) to ensure a proper conversation. This page explains what a hub is.
Creation of Labdoo user accounts. Once decided that the hub is to be created, if the candidates don't have a Labdo user account yet, they need to create one for each of the users that will be managing the hub by going to https://www.labdoo.org/user/register.
Creation of the hub. The superhub creates the new hub by going to the create hub page (this page is available only to users who have superhub rights and it can be found under the 'Hub' tab in the 'Main Navigation Menu') and filling in all the necessary information:
Title. Fill in the title following the naming convetion 'Labdoo Hub HUBNAME', where HUBNAME can be the name of the city or town where the hub is located, the name of a certain suburb, district or community inside a city, or the name of the organization (such as the name of the school, university, NGO or company) hosting the hub. For examples of names, look at the existing list of hubs.
Location. Add the location of your hub and use the map interface to pin down its GPS coordinates.
Hub manager(s). Add the usernames of the users who will be managing this hub.
Parent hub. Some hubs exist as supporting branches of other hubs. For instance, in certain cities, a main hub will have the help of other smaller hubs distributed across various suburbs. These smaller hubs are generally referred as 'branch hubs'. If you are creating a branch hub, select in this field its parent hub. Otherwise, select 'None' in this field. To see tree view of all the hubs and branches, refer to the 'Hubs (tree view)' page under the 'Explore' tab.
Hub type. Select the type of supporting functions the new hub will provide. If the hub can be used as a dropping and storage location where people can bring their contributed dootronics, then check the box 'Dropping point'. If the hub is capable of sanitizing dootronics, check the box 'Sanitizing point'. Multiple boxes can be checked at the same time.
About this hub. If you want to add additional information about this hub, you can do so in this field.
Additional editors. Besides the hub managers, if you would like to give other users the rights to edit this hub, you can do so by adding them in this field.
Assigning roles. The users in charge of managing the hub need to be given the additional role of 'hub manager'. To do this, go to each user page https://www.labdoo-dev.org/users/USERNAME (where USERNAME is the username of the user), click on the tab 'Roles', and activate the checkbox 'hub manager
Email the welcome message. In this last step, you need to send the "Hub Welcome Message" to the new hub managers. You will find this message under this page. Copy and paste the message into an email and send it to the hub managers.



How can I redirect requests to my superhub?
As the manager of a superhub, you may want to have control on how users reach out to you. In this section you will learn how you can use the 'Labdoo Contact' page to redirect requests to your superhub.
The Labdoo contact page is located in this URL: https://www.labdoo.org/content/contact-labdoo. This contact form implements two main features:
Message redirection. It's main feature is that when a user selects a country, if that country belongs to a superhub region, then the message generated when the user submits the contact form is forwarded to the manager of that superhub region.
Preselection of answers. In addition, you can configure the contact form to automatically pre-select either the country or the reason the user is contacting you using the URL parameters 'co' and 're', respectively. Let's see some examples.
If you click on this URL https://www.labdoo.org/content/contact-labdoo?co=de&re=1, you will notice that both the country and the reason fields are prepopulated. That's because the country is passed in the URL with the parameter 'co=de' (which corresponds to the country of Germany) and the reason is passed with the parameter 're=1' (which corresponds to reason #1 in the list: "I want to contribute a trip (dootrip)").
This feature is useful for creating your own customized redirect buttons from your own superhub page to the general contact form in a way that you can preset the answer to each of these two questions if you know where your user is coming from and the reason he/she is trying to contact you.
For a list of country codes that you can use when setting the URL parameter 'co', you can refer to this page: https://countrycode.org/(link is external)
The list of reasons codes is as follows:
're=0': "I want to contribute a laptop or a tablet (dootronic)"
're=1': "I want to contribute a trip (dootrip)"
're=2': "I want to become a Labdoo volunteer (labdooer)"
're=3': "I want to solicit laptops or tablets for my educational project (edoovillage)"
're=4': "I just want to send a message to Labdoo.org"
Here is a use case describing how to put all this together. Let's say that in your front superhub page you want to add a button dedicated to users who are in your region and who want to contribute a dootrip. Then, you would implement this button:
As you can see, when you click on the above button ('Flugpate werden', which in Germany means 'Contribute a trip'), you get redirected to the contact page with the country and reason fields prepopulated to the values of "Germany" and "I want to contribute a trip (dootrip)", respectively.
Here is the HTML code to implement the above button:
<a href="../content/contact-labdoo?co=de&amp;re=1">
<img src="/profiles/labdoo/files/pictures/button-contribute-dootrip-de.png" width="200"/></a>


How can I make my online campaigns more effective?
If you are a superhub manager, you will also be able to encode your own Adwords conversion paths to help make your online campaigns more effective. (More information about conversion paths can be found on the web in places like https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1191209(link is external)).
To enable your own conversion paths, click on the "Hubs" tab located at the top of this page and then click on "[Superhub] Manage adwords". (You will only be able to see this option if your user account has the superhub role enabled.) In the next page, you can edit your existing conversion paths or you can add new ones. To add a new conversion path, click on the link "Add conversion code". This will take you to a page where you can fill in all the necessary information ("Conversion ID", "Language", "Format", "Color" and "Label"). In the last field "Paths", you need to add the URL paths to the page that you want to attach the conversion path to. For instance, if the page is https://www.labdoo.org/content/thank-you-de0, then you need to enter the path "content/thank-you-de0". You can add multiple paths, each one of a separate line.



How can I find a labdoo hub within my city?
Finding a Labdoo hub can be helpful if you want to donate your laptop or pick up laptops for your school (edoovillage). To find a Labdoo hub from a specific city and country, please follow the next steps.
Check the nearest hub using the Hubs dashboard. Below is an example. You can enter other "City" and "Country" values instead of “New York” and “United States”.
Select the country from a drop down menu or enter it using a keyword (free text) to find a hub.
Make sure the "Semaphore" (hub status) is "Open". You cannot contact hubs that are "Inactive" or "Closed".
You can share the URL of the hub with your contact person from Labdoo who can help you connect with its hub manager.
If you need to contact the hub manager directly, you can also follow the next steps.
Once you click on the hub URL, click on the "Hub Manager(s)" field. Please make sure you are logged in using your Labdoo account, otherwise you will not see the "Hub Manager(s)" field.
Once you are on the hub manager's page, go to the "Contact" tab and fill in your info and message.
Note on hubs and branches: Some hubs are marked as "branch". Branches are small hubs that have a parent hub. If you cannot reach out to a branch manager, you can try contacting its parent hub manager too.
Note on hub types: The field "Type" in a hub explains the supporting function of that hub. There are two types of hubs:
Dropping Point: Hubs that accept donation of laptops.
Sanitizing Point: Hubs that will sanitize, test, and convert used laptops into educational laptops. Travelers (dootripers) can pick up the laptops (dootronics).



How to manage edoovillages?
Edoovillages are schools where laptops are deployed. Labdoo focuses on equipping schools because:
Schools have their own organized community.
Classrooms are managed by teachers which can help monitor the good use of the laptops. The role of the teachers is also important to help Labdoo recycle laptops once they no longer work.
Schools typically have electricity and access to the Internet (even in remote areas thanks to the expansion of wireless communications). They also provide water-proof and secure shelters.
Working with schools simplifies also the coordination of dootrips, as many travellers to poor communities visit schools in their trips.
In this chapter you will find information on how to create and manage an edoovillage from within the Labdoo platform. For more general information about Edoovillages please refer also to the "Information for Edoovillages Book".



How can I create an edoovillage?
Labdoo users who have the "hub manager" role assigned are allowed to create new edoovillages. (If you don't have this role and want to solicit the creation of an Edoovillage project in your school, go to www.labdoo.org and press the button "Request laptops".) If you have this role, you can create a new Edoovillage as follows:
Ask the teachers and the people in charge of the school to fill in the 'Edoovillage Request Form'. Please forward to them this form so they can fill it in. Once they reply back with the form filled in, you can proceed with the next step to create the actual edoovillage on the Labdoo platform.
Click on the "Schools" tab that you will find on the top bar of www.labdoo.org and then select the option "Create" (see Figure 1 below). Please notice that you will only see this option if your user account has the permissions of a "hub manager".
Using the information you collected from the 'Edoovillage Request Form', fill in all the fields in the form.
Make sure to also upload the 'Edoovillage Request Form' in the field 'Project application'.
In the "Semaphore" field, please choose the option "Red: pictures about the project have not been uploaded yet". You will be able to set the semaphore to yellow once you get pictures of the school in the next step. You can learn more about the meaning of the 'School Semaphore' from this wiki page.
Once you have filled in all the fields, click on the 'Save' button. If you already have a dootrip associated with this project, make also sure to link the dootrip to the newly created edoovillage. To do so, go to the dootrip page, edit it, and under the field "Preferred edoovillage destinations" specify the newly created edoovillage, then save the dootrip.
Send an email to the school teachers and/or people managing the school providing them the URL link of the newly created edoovillage and ask them to review it. Ask them also to send you pictures of the school. This is important for transparency reasons. Once you have the pictures, upload them to your edoovillage photo album. If you don't know how to do that, follow the steps described in this wiki page. Once you have uploaded the pictures, you can now change the semaphore to yellow. The school is now ready to receive the first small batch of laptops.
Congratulations! At this point, your edoovillage is created and you are now one step closer to make a big contribution towards spreading education around the world. Please continue reading the next section for more pointers on how to manage your edoovillage.



How do I manage my edoovillage?
Each edoovillage comes with a semaphore which is displayed on the upper right part of its dashboard (see Figure below). The semaphore colors have the following meaning:
Red: cannot send dootronics. This is the initial state of an edoovillage. We need to ask recipients to send back pictures of the school. Until those pictures are not received, the semaphore is set to red and no laptops can be sent. Once the pictures of the school are received, the semaphore can be changed to yellow.
Yellow: can send the first small batch of dootronics. This color means that pictures of the school have been received and a first batch of laptops can be sent. This usually means sending a few laptops (i.e., four or five laptops), but not all the laptops solicited. Once the first shipment of laptops is successfully received by the school, and once the school sends back more pictures of the received laptops demonstrating the correct reception, the color of the semaphore can be changed to green.
Green: can send the rest of the dootronics. This color means that the first batch of laptops was successfully received by the school and the school sent back pictures of the laptops. At this point, we are allowed to ship the rest of laptops solicited by the school.
To change the status of your edoovillage semaphore, click on the 'Edit this edoovillage' link (see Figure) that you will find in your edoovillage dashboard (make sure you are logged in to see this link) and change the value of the field 'Semaphore'.
To upload the pictures you received from the school, do as follows:
1. Make sure you are logged in to Labdoo.org. (If you are not logged in, go to https://platform.labdoo.org/user/login and enter your username and password.)
2. Go to your edoovillage. To find your edoovillage page, you can go to "My account" (https://platform.labdoo.org/user) and then click on the "Global contributions" tab. Then click on the link "[See all contributed edoovillages]". This will take you to a dashboard from where you can select your edoovillage.
3. Once you are on the edoovillage page, click on "Go to photo album". This will take you to your photo album. Now you can click on "Upload new photos" where you will be able to upload your new photos. Notice that you will only see the option "Upload new photos" if you have sufficient edoovillage managing rights to do so. If you don't see this option, contact the Labdoo team (https://www.labdoo.org/content/contact-labdoo) giving us your username so that we can provide sufficient rights to your account.
If you have any issues uploading your pictures, contact the Labdoo team at https://www.labdoo.org/content/contact-labdoo.
Note. Before changing the status of a dootronic to S4 (deployed), it's recommend whenever possible to upload the pictures to the corresponding edoovillage first. This order is relevant (first upload the pictures to the edoovillage photo album and then update the laptops associated to that edoovillage to status S4) in order to guarantee that by the time the donors receive the email (this happens when a laptop status is changed to S4) the pictures are available in the edoovillage's photo album for the donors to visit. If the pictures are not available or if it will take some time to receive the pictures, then it is recommended to update the laptops status to S4 and then upload the pictures as soon as they are available.
The creation of edoovillages is restricted to people who belong to a hub, long term volunteers who know how things work and help the following person in the process, this is they way we somehow work, there are allways different people in charge of every step of the process. Someone in the organization creates the edoovillage and someone else in the field is responsible at the destination: informs about the needs and about dootronics reception. It's advisable that these two roles are played by two different persons.
Often the schools can be managed by more than one person who will be able to edit and change the content of the school description and needs.


Do you do trips? What is your trip system?
Dootrips, or Labdoo trips, are CO2-neutral transportation means used to carry dootronics (laptops, tablets, etc.) from one location to another. Examples of dootrips are trips carried out by tourists, NGO volunteers (doctors and engineers without borders, humanitarian personnel, etc.), international students, employees of international corporations, etc. Dootrips constitute a key element within the Labdoo platform to help deliver laptops and tablets loaded with educational software to needy schools without incurring additional CO2 emissions on the planet.
The next sections describe how to create and manage dootrips.


How does the trip/dootrip register works?
If you are traveling and have place in your luggage to bring one or more dootronics (laptops, tablets, etc.), or if you are part of an organization or company which has people traveling or which transports goods from one place to another and have extra room to bring a few more goods, you can register a dootrip to the Labdoo platform. This allows the system to identify routes that connect places where there are unused dootronics with places where dootronics are needed for education purposes.
The steps to register a dootrip are as follows:
If you have not done so, please create first a Labdoo account by going to the registration page: https://platform.labdoo.org/user/register
After you have logged into your Labdoo account, go to the 'Dootrips' tab located on the top of each Labdoo page and click on 'Create' (make sure you are logged in with your user account otherwise you will not see the 'Create' option, https://platform.labdoo.org/node/add/dootrip).
Fill in as many fields in the form as you can. Here are some tips:
If you already know the dootronics that you will carry in your dootrip, please add them in the field 'dootronic identifiers'. If you don't know them yet, you can leave this field empty, and you or some one else can make the assignment some time in the future.
Set the "Status' field to 'Pending'.
Under the field 'Dootrippers', add the username of the person(s) who will be traveling and add also your username. If the person(s) who are traveling don't have a Labdoo account, add only your username.
If you already know the destination school where this dootrip will bring laptops or if you have a preference for the destination school, you can fill in the field 'Preferred edoovillage destinations' with the name of the destination school. Otherwise leave this field empty.
Click on 'save'. At this point your dootrip is registered. It is now important that you contact your closest hub to let them know you will be traveling so they can be aware of your trip and assign laptops that you will be able to carry to your destination. Here is the list of hubs from which you can pick your closest one: https://platform.labdoo.org/hubs
Once you have carried out your dootrip, it is important to modify the field 'Status' to 'Completed'. If for some reason the dootrip was cancelled, set this field to 'Cancelled'.
When creating a dootrip, if you know the destination edoovillage (the project where you plan to bring the laptops to), then it's important that you link your dootrip to the edoovillage by following this simple step:
Go to your dootrip page and click on the 'Edit' tab as usual so you can edit the dootrip information.
Scroll down to the field 'Preferred edoovillage destinations' and type in the name of your destination edoovillage.
Click on "Save".
At this point, your dootrip and your edoovillage are linked. Notice that if you go to the edoovillage page, you will also see your dootrip under the yellow tab "Dootrips".


How can I assign a device/dootronic to a trip?
There are two ways to assign a dootronic to a dootrip, by editing the dootronic or by editing the dootrip:
By editing the dootrip. Go to the dootrip page and click on the "Edit" tab. Make sure that you are logged into your Labdoo account and that you have rights to edit that dootrip, otherwise you will not be able to see the "Edit" tab. Under the field 'Dootronic identifiers', add the Labdoo ID of the dootronic. Then click on 'Save'.
By editing the dootronic. Go to the dootronic page (your laptop or tablet page) and click on the "Edit" tab. Make sure that you are logged into your Labdoo account and that you have rights to edit that dootronic, otherwise you will not be able to see the "Edit" tab. Under the field 'Dootrips assigned to this dootronic', type the dootrip name. Then click on 'Save'.



How can I manage notifications and dootrips?
To facilitate the process of communicating and managing dootrips, Labdoo users involved in a dootrip can receive any of the following automatic email notifications:
Travelers and related users upon dootrip creation. Every time a dootrip is created, the travelers and users related to that dootrip receive a notification email.
Labdoo users who have projects in the dootrip's destination country. When a dootrip is created with the option "Announce this dootrip" checked, a notification email is sent out to all Labdoo edoovillage and hub managers who have an open edoovillage in a country equal to the destination country of the dootrip. This allows these users to know about the existence of that dootrip, giving them the option to claim the resource for the transport of dootronics to that edoovillage. Please notice that this type of notifications will be send out only if you select the checkbox "Announce this dootrip". To avoid sending out unnecessary false alarms to other users, it is recommended that you keep this option turned OFF if you already have dootronics assigned to your trip and cannot carry any more dootronics.
Travelers and related users upon dootrip expiration. When a dootrip expires, if it's status is still pending, a notification email is sent out to travelers and users related to that dootrip to remind them to update the dootrip status.
In addition to the above notifications, users will receive the following set of reminders:
Upon a dootrip expiration. Five days after a dootrip expires, if the dootrip status has not been changed to 'Completed' or 'Cancelled', then the users in charge of that dootrip will receive an email reminder to update the status of the dootrip. This email reminder is sent three times, each one separated by 5 days. That is, the reminder is sent 5 days, 10 days and 15 days after the dootrip has been completed and as long as the status is not changed.


How does your newsletter work?
The feature 'Newsletters' provide you with a tool to outreach your regional community by creating your own newsletter issues. This feature allows you to:
Maintain a list of subscribed users interested in receiving your newsletter issues. When users register to Labdoo.org, they are given an option to subscribe to your newsletter (this option is also available from each users' account dashboard). This allows you to build your own community of followers and communicate with them periodically via your newsletter.
Create, edit and send out your periodic issues. As a newsletter manager, you have access to a dashboard from where you can create and edit your new issues. Once you are done, the same dashboard provides a button to submit the issue to your subscribed users. Users receive your newsletter via email.



How can I write my own newsletter?
If you want to manage your own newsletter, please send an email to contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail) and ask the Labdoo team to assign the role of 'Newsletter manager' to your account. Once this is done, you will see a new 'Newsletter' tab on the top Main Navigation Menu. By clicking on 'Newsletter' and then 'Create an issue' you will be taken to a dashboard where you can create and edit your newsletter as shown in the next figure.

We recommend you to do so prior to sending the final version out to your whole audience.


What does Labdoo stand for?
Labdoo stands for Laboratories for Education; the name is also related to the concept of “building Laboratories for Education one location at a time.” It stands for the idea that everyone can make a difference in a child’s education.


What’s the premise of the Labdoo project?
Labdoo is unique in that we’re a grassroots, collaborative community of volunteers from around the globe each contributing in their own part in bringing education closer to a child. It is based upon the simple idea that a large project can be simplified and made sustainable by dividing it into smaller tasks. You don’t need every person to be in the same location or need each person to have all the know-how in order to get a laptop successfully refurbished and sent to a child.
Labdoo is able to provide the logistical resources to help organize this wide network of laptops and volunteers through social networking tools and through the implementation of concepts such as "dootronic", “tagging”, “dootrip”, "hubs", "edoovillages", etc.


What is a 'dootronic'?
"Dootronic" stands for Labdoo Electronic and is defined as any electronic device capable of delivering education to a child. It could be a laptop, a tablet, an ebook, or even a powerful smartphone, as any of these devices can have a tremendous capability of bringing educational content to children. Some people call them 'donated devices', others call them 'educational devices'; it's really up to you, but as a general term, we use the word 'dootronic'.


What is 'tagging'?
"Tagging" is part of Labdoo’s solution to mobilize laptops. When you “tag” your laptop you’re simply registering it in Labdoo’s online inventory. In registering you’re only entering information about the laptop (e.g. memory, operating system, etc.). In the event there is a call for dootronics we can notify individuals who’ve tagged their laptops to see if they wish to donate them. Tagging is a key component of the Labdoo workflow because it enables transparency and allows us to efficiently organize information, which helps cut the cost of the project down to practically zero. Thanks to this and other pieces of the system, Labdoo requires no funding to sustain itself. (See this wiki entry for more detail on this concept.)


I’m not quite ready to donate this laptop, should I still tag it?
Yes! Tagging in itself does not imply that you’re donating your laptop now or at any point. It’s simply making you and your laptop become part of the overall Labdoo network, expressing that when you no longer need to use that laptop, you'd like a child from some needy school to use it and gain access to educational content.


How do you tag a laptop?
Go to labdoo.org and create a user account if you have not already.
Once you are logged into your account, click on the menu tab "dootronics" and then on "Tag", this will bring you to a form to fill in.
Enter as much information about the laptop as you can (while most of the fields are optional, the more information you provide, the smarter the decisions we make will be in terms of assigning a laptop to a school project). Click Save, you will receive a 9 digit tag number.
You have successfully tagged your laptop!


How can I be sure that all the information on my computer is properly erased?
Labdooers around the globe who take charge of sanitizing a laptop (people like you actually) go through a full erasing of the hard drive when refurbishing the computer. When installing the new operating system and a very powerful education software package, a process called shredding randomly writes zeros and ones to the hard drive to make sure all the data that was previously on the hard drive is gone forever.



How do you decide where the laptops are sent?
Labdoo delivers education devices (dootronics) to hundreds of schools around the world. We search for and have been sought out by organizations with education projects that meet Labdoo's goals. As part of the Labdoo network, you can even create your own school destination projects too. By the way, we call them "edoovillages".



How long does it take for a laptop to be delivered to a school?
The answer to this question really depends on many factors, such as the demand for laptops, the availability of travelers in your area going to a Labdoo school, and the availability of volunteer time to sanitize your laptop and make it ready for traveling. In some cases, it can be quite quick, even just a couple of weeks; but in other cases it can take months. Keep in mind that Labdoo is a global project that moves laptops around the world at no cost, thanks to the collaboration of many people, so sometimes you may need to be patient to see some progress. In any case, please do check from time to time the status of your donation and contact Labdoo if you see that no progress has been made for a while.



How do you ship laptops to their locations?
For that, we use "dootrips" (or Labdoo trips). A dootrip is essentially a CO2-neutral transportation means used to carry laptops from one location to another. Examples of dootrips are trips carried out by tourists, NGO volunteers (doctors and engineers without borders, humanitarian personnel, etc.), international students, employees of international corporations, etc. Through the Labdoo social network, people and organizations that travel can register their trip and donate a CO2-neutral transportation resource to bring one or more laptops to schools in need. This approach costs no money and more importantly, it preserves planet Earth.



What is a Labdoo hub?
Everybody can be a participant in the Labdoo network by performing a Labdoo activity. When one or more of the participants act together regularly carrying out a good number of activities, they can optionally become a hub. A hub can be understood as a node in the network which carries out a “larger density of Labdoo activities”. An example of a hub could be a group of university students who get together from time to time to carry out activities such as collecting and sanitizing unused laptops, organizing dootrips, recycling technology, carrying out outreaching activities, etc. Hubs can also be implemented in high schools, companies, neighbor communities, at home or in any type of organized community.



What do you do with the laptops once they’re donated to a Labdoo hub?
Donated laptops are checked out to see if they are still in a useable condition or ready to be recycled. If they are still useable, we’ll tag them —if they have not been already—, and then we'll refurbish them (i.e. clean them, clear the hard drive, and install Edubuntu, a simple but powerful Linux based operating system with lots of education applications and available in practically all languages).



What do you do with donated laptops that are broken?
Short answer: We recycle them. Long answer: We look for partners with a recycling facility who can guarantee that the broken laptop will be recycled safely. Electronic waste is a huge problem, and one of Labdoo's goals is to help efficiently solve this problem by going through proper recycling facilities.



What do you do with laptops that break down while being deployed in their respective locations?
A laptop that breaks down while being deployed can be reported through the main website, labdoo.org. From there we can inform volunteers or partnering groups that work or are traveling through the area to pick up the laptop and bring it to a proper recycling facility.



I’m ready to donate my laptop, where can I drop it off?
You have several options. If you or someone you know are traveling to a location near a destination school, you can consider bringing it yourself all the way to the school. Otherwise, you can also take it to your closest Labdoo hub. People in the hub will then take care of identifying a dootrip to bring the laptop to a school.



What happens with projects that don’t have access to internet?
All the laptops we send off get installed a copy of Edubuntu which is an educational software based in the Ubuntu Linux Operating System. This software provides educational games, computer typing development and an introduction to technology to students abroad. In addition to Edubuntu, we are also supply them with a stripped-down version of Wikipedia through a burned CD and with many more educational applications and electronic books so that children can have access to them without the need of Internet.



Can I still contribute even if I don’t know much about computers?
Yes! In fact, knowledge about computers is only a very small portion of the Labdoo project. So come and join the Labdoo mission by registering and/or contacting us at contact@labdoo.org(link sends e-mail).



How can I get updates about Labdoo?
You can find updated information about Labdoo by going to the website https://www.labdoo.org. Also, when you tag your laptop, you receive a Labdoo ID, and you're asked to provide your e-mail address, where you will receive automatic notifications of the status of your donated laptops and pictures of them as they make progress to a school.

LABDOO is a humanitarian social network joined by people around the world who want to make our planet a better place by providing those in underdeveloped regions (both in the developing and the developed world) a chance at a better education. The goal of the social network is to send unused laptops, ebook readers, tablet-PCs and any device that can be loaded with educational software to needy schools around the world using collaboration and without incurring any economic nor environmental costs.

To set the ground, at Labdoo we call these unused computer devices dootronics, as in labdoo electronics. A dootronic is therefore any laptop, tablet, ebook or device in general that can be loaded with educational software and sustainably transported to a needy school.
The world retires every year hundreds of millions of dootronics that are still in perfect condition. Simply by sanitizing and loading them with learning software, they can become a very powerful tool to unlock education around the world.

How is it possible to collect unused learning devices around the world and sustainably send them where needed without damaging the Planet? Namely, through the combination of two basic building blocks: (1) technology/information sharing and (2) massive global goodwill collaboration. To achieve sustainable organic growth and prevent damaging the planet, we use a collaborative grassroots social networking system. This allows Labdoo to globally unlock resources which are found in excess capacity (such as unused laptops, travelers, know-how, goodwill, etc.). Labdoo and its approach to help bring education around the globe has been acknowledged by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as "promoting a valuable and sustainable contribution to the development of educational learning in foreign countries"

How does Labdoo work and how can I make a contribution towards helping spread education? Through five simple steps:
STEP 1. Tag your unused dootronics. Do you have unused laptops or devices that can be repurposed for education? or do you know a friend, a relative, an organization or a company who has them? then the first step is to tag the devices (the dootronics) you collect so that they can be efficiently organized inside the global inventory. To tag a dootronic, log into your Labdoo account (create your own account first if you have not done so yet) and from the menu located at the top of this page click on the option "Dootronics" and then the sub-option "Tag". In this step, the dootronic is marked with status S0 (tagged) or S1 (donated).
STEP 2. Sanitize your dootronics. Once tagged, the dootronic needs to be sanitized and loaded with the educational software. You have two options here: (1) you can do this process on your own by following the steps decribed in the sanitation manual; (2) alternatively, you can locate your closest Labdoo hub where you can bring the dootronic so that other labdooers in the hub can carry out the sanitation process for you. In this step, the dootronic is marked with status S2 (sanitized) or S3 (assigned to a school).
STEP 3. Identify a dootrip. Once the dootronic is sanitized, we need to identify a CO2-neutral traveling resource that can bring it to a school. We call this type of transportation resource dootrip (as in Labdoo trip). Here again you have two options: (1) if you are traveling to a location near to a needy school, then register your own dootrip by clicking on "Dootrips" and then "Create" from the menu located at the top of this page and use your own trip to bring the laptop to a destination school; (2) alternatively, you can also bring the dootronic to your closest Labdoo hub where other labdooers can help find a dootrip resource to transport it to a school. In this step, the dootronic is marked with status T1 (in transit).
STEP 4. Track your dootronics towards 'mission accomplished'. You can track the progress your dootronic makes towards reaching a school by selecting from the menu at the top of this page the option "Dootronic" and then the sub-option "My dootronics" (make sure you are logged into your account.) Click on the specific dootronic, you will be able to see information such as its current status, its geolocalization or its associated destination school. Play around, you will see that you have many different ways to track and contribute to the progress of your dootronic to complete its mission, including options such as uploading pictures, linking a dootronic to a dootrip, reviewing its historical records, and ensuring its status and parameters are most up to date, among many others. In this step, the dootronic is marked with status S4 (delivered).
STEP 5. Recycle broken dootronics. The final destination of all devices is a recycling center, so that we can preserve the environment and eleminate electronic waste. If you detect that a deployed device stops functioning, you can change its status and request a dootrip to rescue it and properly recycle it. In this step, the dootronic is marked with status S5 (broken) or S6 (recycled).
All the above steps are oriented towards having the learning devices making progress to schools, following the various states S0, S1, S2, S3, T1, S4, S5


As a social network, Labdoo allows you to do a lot more beyond the above basic steps. Among other tasks, you can join teams for a given subject of interest, share your experiences helping increase the global knowledge base, ask questions in the various walls, upload pictures to your walls or projects (pictures help increase transparency in the platform as well as the level of awareness), create your own tasks and manage them via a calendar, engage in chat conversations with other labdooers, access and contribute to the Labdoo wiki knowledge-base, and you can even create your own Labdoo hub to help mobilize dootronics in your local area. Check out the "things you can do to help spread education" wiki entry to get a quick summary of all the things you can do.
Here are some quick final pointers:
To join a team, go to the "Teams" menu option on the top of this page.
The wiki is our live central knowledge-base where most of the documents, manuals and material can be found. You can access it by clicking on the "Wiki" menu option.
'The Labdoo Social Network - How It Works' wiki book describes in more detail how the collaborative aid platform works.
In the 'Labdoo toolkit' you will find tools to help you take further actions such as initiating your own Labdoo local awareness campaigns.
For any questions, don't hesitate to post them on any of the Teams wall.


Gilts (good labdoo habits)
Tagging and Documentation: Always tag your dootronic before donation, take pictures, and ask for the donor's email for transparency. This ensures tracking and updates throughout the process.
Cleaning and Preparation: Clean the device thoroughly, use a solution of 50% water and 50% alcohol, and ensure you provide the power adapter. Keep a healthy inventory of spare components like hard drives and RAM.
Community Involvement: Ask relatives and friends for unused dootronics and potential dootrips. Encourage getting dootronics from known transparent sources. Share this list of good habits (Gilts) with your community regularly.
Inventory Management: Use post-it notes to visually mark dootronics when you have a large number of them, and remember to print and attach the 'Dootronics Welcome Package' when delivering multiple devices.
Status Updates: Update the status of dootronics and dootrips on the Labdoo platform as soon as possible to maintain transparency and efficiency.
Recycling and Rescuing: Properly recycle dootronics that are no longer functional to prevent e-waste. Rescue as many broken devices as possible and take them to proper recycling facilities.
Sharing Knowledge and Experiences: Share your experiences and ask questions openly using the various online Labdoo teams to contribute to the project's knowledge base.
Spam Prevention: Detect and report spam or fraudulent messages promptly to protect the integrity of the Labdoo platform.
Testing Devices: Test that a dootronic boots up correctly as soon as you receive it to ensure it is functional and identify any potential issues early on.
Ongoing Communication: If you are a hub manager, periodically send this list of good Labdoo habits (Gilts) to your local community to reinforce best practices.

Labdoo Global Support (LGS) Program
When a dootronic is deployed at a school and a mini-mission is accomplished, is the Labdoo effort completed? as you probably guess, the answer is no. Labdoo's goal is to deliver laptops loaded with education to schools but also to ensure that all laptops, once they no longer work, are properly recycled to make a more a sustainable world, and many things can happen between the deployment and recycling time that could still require Labdoo's aid.
One of the big things we try to accomplish after a dootronic is deployed at a school is to ensure that it continues to run as healthy as possible to maximize its lifespan until it is time to recycle it. This effort is made possible thanks to the Labdoo Global Support (LGS) Team, a program run by Labdoo volunteers from around the world who provide online help to students, teachers and staff members of edoovillages in resolving their dootronic (laptops, tablets, ebooks, etc.) related technical questions.
If we were a company selling laptops, the Labdoo Global Support Program would be what people in the business world commonly refer as "After-Sales Support". Labdoo is however not a company, but a humanitarian social project. Not only that, as you know, Labdoo does not accept monetary donations and does not use money to run its logistical system, so we can't rely on the traditional business approach to support laptops deployed in the field. Instead, we apply once again the same strategy we use to solve every challenge we encounter along our way: global collaboration and distributed technology. Labdoo's Global Support Program works by collecting drops of goodwill from everywhere in the planet united to help resolve technical questions that may arise to users located in the most disadvantaged areas of the world. In a nutshell, LGS provides a wall-like interface that allows students, teachers and staff members of the schools that receive laptops to write their technical questions. On that wall, Labdooers distributed across the planet help resolve the posted questions. Since Labdoo has physical presence in the five continents, the end result is a 24/7/365 (all days of the year) interactive online system that provides both technical support to people from the schools while at the same time it helps to continue to grow the global pool of knowledge (knowledgebase).


The LGS Workflow
Here is how the LGS workflow works:
When a laptop is sanitized and packaged, print and attach the Labdoo Global Support Sheet as part of the shipment.
Upon receiving a dootronic, users will see the LGS sheet and learn from it how to post their questions via the LGS system. This step is also described under the What if I want to Receive Aid from the LGS Support Team section.
When a dootronic user posts a question via the LGS system, members of the LGS team receive a notification email and are able to provide answers to the questions also via the LGS system. This step is also described in detail under the What if I Want to be Part of the LGS Team section.
This process ensures both (1) that dootronic users' technical questions are efficiently answered and (2) that we continue to build an online global knowledgebase of questions and answers that other users can benefit from.
Please notice the following when using the LGS support team:
While we will do an effort in replying to all possible languages, the world has more than 6000 languages and so we can't presume we can understand all of them. The recommended language to make questions is English because, although we also have Labdooers who are proficient in other languages such as German, Chinese, Spanish, Italian, French, and Catalan. Please try to use any of these languages unless there is no other way around for you.
Labdoo has a pretty good team of volunteers throughout the world who are familiar with the technical aspects of a laptop and computers in general, but we can't promise that we know all the answers. We will do our best though. Please notice that all answers are provided 'as is' and according to the Labdoo Terms and Conditions that you will find in your account (https://www.labdoo.org/user) under the 'Edit account' tab.
There are also many good knowledge bases and blogs in the Internet where you may find answers to your questions. Feel free to look for them as well using your favorite web search engine, you will find them very useful too. For instance, you can check sites such as askubuntu.com.

reply.


labdoo km0
What it is:
Labdoo Km0 is a workflow inside the Labdoo platform dedicated to helping those neighboring schools right next to you that are affected by the digital divide.
Why it exists:
Labdoo Km0 is one of the workflows implemented by the Labdoo platform designed to operate locally at a global scale. The objective of this program is to eradicate the digital divide found in our neighbour communities by delivering educational laptops using Labdoo’s circular economy.
The Outcome:
Labdoo Km0 provides a very simple process that anyone can do. In just 4 hours of your time, you can change the life of a child and help significantly reduce the effects of climate change. Every time you recycle a laptop and give it to a needy child, you are:
Creating an incredible educational opportunity to that child.
Helping to flatten the climate change curve by reducing 18.59 Kgms of CO2 for each rescued laptop.
How it works:
Step 1. Collect an unused laptop (estimated time 1 hours). Everyone knows somebody who has an unused laptop, possibly even you have one! Start by collecting the unused laptops from your friends and family and tag it: https://platform.labdoo.org/content/step-1-collecting-unused-laptops
Step 2. Sanitize the laptop (estimated time: 2 hours). Follow the Labdoo sanitation process to re-install a new operating system into the laptop and then load it with a very powerful educational package that includes the Wikipedia, Khan Academy and between 30GB and 300GB of high-quality educational content: https://platform.labdoo.org/content/step-2-sanitizing-laptop
Step 3. Deliver the laptop (estimated time: 1 hour). The happiest moment, identify a school or NGO in your local neighbourhood or village/town that needs laptops to fight the digital divide and deliver it: https://platform.labdoo.org/content/step-3-delivering-laptops-project


Labdoo for Cities
Labdoo for Cities is a program that allows cities from around the world to implement the Labdoo collaborative workflow in a simple and sustainable manner. In a nutshell, Labdoo for cities works as follows:
The Town Hall of the village, town or city creates first a Labdoo dropping point. This is a location where citizens can bring their unused but working laptops and tablets. This reception point is in charge of one main task: tagging the received dootronics and storing them in a drawer or some room. This step also leverages the great capabilities that the Town Hall has in reaching out to all of its citizens (via its standard channels such as the city news magazine, or the local radio and TV stations) enabling community awareness to help mobilize computers and new volunteers interested in the cause.
One or more sanitation hubs are also created in the city. Our experience says that one very sustainable and educating way to do this step is by implementing the sanitation hubs in the various local schools (high school level). This allows young students to be part of the solution, allowing them to learn the concepts of recycling, sustainable international development, and global collaboration in a very hands on manner. Sanitation hubs can naturally be created in many other places besides schools, including homes, NGOs or local companies.
In this step 2, volunteers from the sanitizing hubs pick up tagged laptops from the dropping point hubs.
Students and/or volunteers from the sanitation hubs clean up the laptops and install the educational software following the general Labdoo workflow.
Sanitized laptops are transported to needy schools using sustainable dootrips, as is also done in the general Labdoo workflow.
While the above workflow has been demonstrated to be simple and efficient, cities can develop their own modified workflows based on their capabilities and needs. If you are interested in implementing Labdoo for Cities in your own village, town or city, please reach out to the Labdoo Team at contact@labdoo.org and we will help you get started.



Labdoo for Cities: Protocol
The following protocol describes the actions that need to be taken by the dropping point hub (Town Hall) when receiving laptops from the citizens and when handing laptops to the sanitation hubs
Laptop management protocol for Labdoo Dropping Point Hubs
When your hub receives a laptop from a donor:
Remember to ask the donor for his/her email address if he/she wishes to receive email updates as the laptops makes progress to a school.
Go to the tagging page ['Dootronics' → Tag it!'] Https://platform.labdoo.org/ca/node/add/laptop
Fill in all fields under the 'Basic information' tab. Set the status of the laptop to "S1" and set the "Source hub" field to the name of your dropping point hub so that the laptop remains connected to your hub inventory. Upload also a picture of the laptop in the corresponding field.
Fill out the "Additional notification emails" field with the email address that the donor gave you in step 1. You will find this field in the 'Additional information' tab.
Click on the button 'Save' ('Save') at the bottom of the page. At this point the dootronic's page is created, sending also an email to your hub and to the donor's email address that you set in step 4.
Click on the button "Print tags" at the top of the page on your new dootronic. Print the three labels. Cut the three labels and stick them with transparent tape on the laptop: one label goes underneath the laptop, another one goes inside the battery compartment and a third label needs to be attached to the power adapter. Make sure the tape fully covers all these labels and that they are firmly attached to the laptop and the adapter.
When your hub gives a laptop to a sanitation hub.
Go to the dootronics dashboard: ['Dootronics' → 'View'] https://www.labdoo.org/ca/content/dootronics-dashboard
In the "Free-Text Search" field, put the 9-digit number of the laptop you want to give to the sanitation hub. This will automatically update the table showing only the relevant dootronic. Click on this dootronic.
Click on the 'Edit' button. Make sure you are logged into your account Labdoo, otherwise you will not see the button 'Edit'.
Change the "Manager" and add instead the user name in charge of the sanitation hub.
In the "Source hub" field, click on the button "Add another item" and add the name of the sanitation hub. Make sure that both your dropping point hub and the recipient sanitation hub are in the "Source hub" field so that the laptop appears in the inventory of both hubs.
Repeat all the above steps for each of the laptops that you want to give to a sanitation hub.


Labdoo for Cities Flyer
If you are implementing Labdoo for Cities in your village or town, it will be handy for you to distribute a flyer to the local villagers to spread awareness and to let them know that they can bring their unused laptops and tablets to their closest dropping point hub. Below you can download a sample flyer to serve this purpose.
There are different ways to distribute the flyer. In some cases, the Town Hall offers to print the flyer and distribute it using its own channels. This approach is very effective because the Town Hall has very well established ways to reach out to the local villagers (through the local newspapers, radio, TV, etc.). For instance, often the Town Hall can distribute the flyer via its local newsletter sent periodically to inform villagers about new initiatives. Other approaches include printing flyers and putting them in the local bakeries, bookstores, libraries or any place where they can be freely and easily distributed to passing by villagers. Be creative when carrying out your own outreaching campaigns!
To customize the following flyers with your own village/city information or to translate it to another language, please reach us out at contact@labdoo.org.



Labdoo's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Package
1. About the Labdoo CSR Package
When it comes to spreading education around the world, we can all be part of the solution, whether its by tagging or cleaning up a laptop, by contributing a trip to bring education to a school, or simply by spreading the word out to mobilize your community. There is a large variety of things (small, medium, or larger tasks) you can do to help out with our global mission.
Among all the people and organizations that are part of the global community, companies play a key role when it comes to helping those that are most in need. This package is specially designed to let companies contribute to the Labdoo cause and at the same time benefit from it as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy.
Two main reasons led us to the creation of the Labdoo CSR package:
Resources. Companies are incredibly well connected and have access to a very large pool of human and technology resources. It is often the case that a small action carried out by a company can have large effects to those who are most in need.
Goodwill and reputation. More and more companies are looking for ways to contribute back to the community. We as a people understand that life is not just only about revenue bottom lines, but also about community and helping each other to make the world a better place. Doing good things for the community also helps companies increase their reputation, and provides an example for others to do the same.
These two reasons provide a win-win opportunity addressed by this CSR package. By participating, companies are both doing a great contribution to the community while helping increase their goodwill reputation providing an example for others to follow.
If you are interested in participating in the Labdoo CSR program, please contact us at contact@labdoo.org.
2. How Does it Work
Deep into Labdoo's DNA there is the notion of finding the right task for every person and organization who participates. This is very important for one key reason: long term sustainability. A task should fit your capabilities, not too small, not too large, just the right fit. That's why we designed Project Labdoo.org following a bottom-up approach. What does that mean? in short, it means that you get to decide what action you want to help with. There is a very simple principle behind this approach: you know your capabilities, your preferences, skills and passions better than anyone else, so you and your organization are most appropriate to make this decision.
As a result, the Labdoo CSR package is designed to be simple to understand. The package includes a list of actions you can do to help with the mission of spreading education around the world and you get to choose which ones you want to carry out. Tasks are organized into modules and depending on which module you implement, you get one of the various recognition levels: World Ambassador, World Activist or World Changer.
Our recommendation is also simple: start small, choose a simple initial task, implement it, learn from it, and if you feel you can, grow your level of contribution one step at a time.



3. CSR Modules
Companies can choose to implement one of the following three contribution modules.
3.1. World Ambassador Module. The main objective of this module is to spread the word out that Project Labdoo.org exists and to help mobilize local communities towards the goal of moving laptops and tablets to needy schools. This is for the most part an outreaching/networking package. As a company, you are very well connected to communities such as your own employees or other companies and simply spreading the word can lead to other great contributions. There are several great things you can do to help spread the word out as part of the World Ambassador module. You will be recognized with this contribution level if you do at least one of the following tasks:
Let your employees know how they can donate their unused laptops. Using your internal network, you can inform your employees how their unused laptops can potentially change the education path of a child.
Let your employees know how they can contribute a dootrip. A dootrip (a Labdoo Trip) is defined as a CO2-neutral trip that someone needs to do (for business, for holidays, etc.) and that is re-purposed to carry a laptop to a destination. Inform your employees about the possibility of contributing a dootrip to bring laptops closer to a needy school.
Encourage your employees to create a Labdoo hub. A Labdoo hub is a location where people can bring unused laptops and where volunteers help sanitize and install the education software following the steps in the Labdoo Sanitation Toolkit. Encourage your employees to create a hub on their own to help make the world a cleaner place while spreading education.
Spread the word outside your company boundaries. You can do all the above by letting other companies (maybe you suppliers, your customers or collaborators) know about Project Labdoo. Maybe your company has a booth at a tradeshow and you might be interested in doing your CSR work by advertising the Labdoo cause from your both. It can be as simple as printing the Labdoo CSR Package Flyer and distributing it away.
The task of implementing the World Ambassador CSR module is in fact simplified because the Labdoo tools already provide most of the material you need to help spread the word out. For instance, you can freely print the Labdoo poster to help explain the movement, you can attach the Labdoo videos to your outreaching messages, you can print out the Labdoo CSR Flyer to distribute to your collaborators, or you can even create your own roll up by using the Labdoo roll up design. You can readily find all of these outreaching materials and designs in the Labdoo toolkit.
3.2. World Activist Module. The World Activist module includes the World Ambassador package plus additional contributions made directly by the company. In particular, your company will be recognized with this contribution level if one or more of the following tasks are carried out:
Dootronics contribution. The company contributes more than 50 unused laptops or tablets in a year.
Dootrips contribution. The company contributes more than 10 dootrips in a year.
Hub contribution. The company creates a Labdoo hub as part of its community work and helps to collect and sanitize more than 10 laptops a year.
3.3. World Changer Module. The World Changer module includes the World Ambassador package plus additional contributions made directly by the company. In particular, your company will be recognized with this contribution level if one or more of the following tasks are carried out:
Dootronics contribution. The company contributes more than 1000 unused laptops or tablets in a year.
Dootrips contribution. The company contributes more than 100 dootrips in a year.
Hub contribution. The company creates one or more Labdoo hubs as part of its community work and helps to collect and sanitize more than 100 laptops a year.
4. Other Special Contributions
Some organizations may be able to participate in Labdoo's CSR Program by contributing other resources not specified in the above packages too. This allows these organizations to better leverage their own specific capabilities, resources and know-how. Examples are organizations which can contribute other types of goods such as books, photo and video cameras, or large scale awareness campaigns, to name just a few. When an organization offering these special contributions wants to join the Labdoo's CSR Program, the application will be considered on a case by case basis. When accepted, these organizations will also be given one of the above recognition levels (world ambassador, world activist or world changer) depending on their degree of contribution.


Labdoo Stories
Labdoo is a collaborative social network that allows us to efficiently sanitize unused laptops and tablets and bring them to schools. But it is much more than just a collaborative logistical platform. Above all, Labdoo is the story of each of us connected in serendipitous ways across continents and oceans, all of us united with a common theme: to help each other in the pursue of a better education and a more sustainable planet.
Along the way, we encountered some amazing stories that were so inspiring that we think it's important to share them with the world and to preserve them for the future. Moreover, we found that behind every one of our edoovillages and hubs there is an inspiring story of people working together to make our world a better place. For all of this, we created Labdoo Stories, a function within the Labdoo Social Network that allows edoovillages and hubs to write about and share their stories.



How 'Labdoo Stories' work
Every edoovillage and hub part of the Labdoo platform has a story that speaks to the world: Why was it first created? What challenges did you have to overcome? What motivated you to create your edoovillage or hub? What are the anecdotes and inspiring moments of your story that are worth sharing with the world? How are the laptops helping you and other people to gain a better education and in which ways? Labdoo stories is a function inside the Labdoo social network that allows you to write and share these remarkable human stories.
Here are the steps you need to follow to create a Labdoo Story:
Be an edoovillage or hub manager. To talk about the story of an edoovillage or hub, you need to have created and managed one, naturally. So first thing to keep in mind is that while everyone can read the Labdoo Stories published through the platform, only users with the role of edoovillage or hub manager can create and edit them. If you want to write a Labdoo Story and don't have have any of these user roles, email the Labdoo team at contact@labdoo.org.
Have a good story. We encourage all edoovillage and hub managers to write their Labdoo Story because we are convinced that all of you have a good story to share. Just because you decided to take a step forward in helping the world become a better place by creating a school or a hub, that alone makes your story worth sharing. Tell the world why you created your hub or edoovillage, what were the challenges in doing so, how the laptops are helping you and others to gain a better education or, simply, tell us any of your anecdotes that can inspire the world. With that in mind, you can go to the next step.
Write it. Ok so you are an edoovillage or hub manager and have a good story to share, hence, you are encouraged by the Labdoo community to write about it. To do so, go to your edoovillage or hub dashboard and click on the 'pencil' icon located on the right colum where it says 'Write a story about the edoovillage/hub'. This will take you to a page where you will be able to compose and write your story. Stories are formed by 'sections', and each section is formed by three elements: a heading, the text of that section and a picture. Each of these elements is optional, to give you both simplicity and flexibility of composition. For instance, if you don't want to use various subtitles to organize your story (similar to a prose narrative), you can omit writing the heading in each section. Or you can add multiple heading, pieces of text or images as you need. One important requirement is that when you upload pictures, please ensure they are of good quality and that they illustrate well the work you are doing (for instance, pictures of the laptops being used by the students, pictures of the school or the local community, or something original and creative that connects with your story.) Once you are done, click on the 'Save' button to save your story. If you need to make any changes, you can click on the 'Edit' tab to go back to edition mode. You can take a look at this page for an example of Labdoo Story.
Once created, your story can be reached by clicking on the 'Story' tab found on your edoovillage or hub dashboard. Stories can also be reached by going to the 'Explore' tab located at the top menu of every Labdoo page and by clicking on the 'Labdoo stories' option.

Values, Philosophy and Principles of the Labdoo Project
Labdoo is a collaborative humanitarian social network which is designed to help bring laptops and educational devices to schools in need without incurring any economic or environmental costs.
In the world, those who have access to free sources of education (FSE) are the rare exception. This is a problem because:
It leads to inequalities between those who have access to FSE and those who don't.
The potential talent of most of the children in the world and the societal benefits that would arise from it are lost.
This reality is commonly known as the 'digital divide'.
A laptop allows schools to gain access to FSE, helping to unlock the skills and potential capabilities of children and students. This can be achieved via offline education software that comes installed in the laptops or via online education content.
Labdoo exists as 'a tool' to help sustainably coordinate the mobilization of unused educational devices and to bring them to needy schools using global collaboration, without incurring any economic cost and without damaging the Planet.

How Does Labdoo Deliver its Mission?
The mechanism to deliver Labdoo's mission is via the creation of a humanitarian social network. This social network provides the following functions:
It provides an efficient way to organize information: identification of sources of demand, supply, laptops, dootrips, QA resources, etc.
It provides a way to break down a very large mission (solving the digital divide) into a very large number of very small tasks (tagging, sanitizing, storage, dootrip, etc.). Each of these tasks becomes so small that its cost is negligible.
It provides a way for everyone to be part of the solution (community building). Every person can have his/her own mini-mission.
Since all the information and activities are openly available through the humanitarian social network, it provides transparency.
As a flat humanitarian project, it helps to break barriers and stereotypes between the beneficiaries and the benefactors. For instance, in the Labdoo network, aid can originate from the developing world and be received by the developed world.
It is fun.

Labdoo as a Tool
Labdoo provides an open and free tool: the tool is the humanitarian social network and the toolkit found in it that allows everyone to carry out his or her own mini-mission. The tool is provided “as is”, which means that people developing it cannot be liable for how the tool is used. This concept is similar to other well known projects such as the GNU Project.
The source code that runs the Labdoo social network is fully and freely available from the following github repo: https://github.com/labdoo

Labdoo's Zero Funding Target Approach
Our philosophy
You may have noticed that within the Labdoo.org system there is no place for people to make a monetary donation and the platform is 100% advertisement free. That's because Labdoo runs simply out of people's goodwill through the contribution of people's time (global collaboration) and unused resources such as laptops or travelers' luggage space (excess capacity), and therefore we require no investors to carry out our cause. We call this a "zero funding organization".
The Labdoo team presented the idea of zero funding organizations in the paper “Humanitarian Social Networks and Positive Sum Development” presented at the 2013 International Conference on Sustainable Development Practice, in New York. Zero-funding organizations are a special case of traditional nonprofit organizations and the concept of social businesses introduced by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus in his book ”Creating a World Without Poverty: Social Business and the Future of Capitalism”. A zero funding organization is a non-profit organization and a social business which is self-sustainable without any major source of monetary funding, including philanthropic donations, external investment funding or even internal profits. A zero funding organization is a special case of a nonprofit organizations because it generates no monetary profits, only social profits. It is also a special case of Yunus’ concept of social businesses because, since there is no money involved, its objective can only be social.
In summary, zero funding organizations are both nonprofit organizations and social businesses that eliminate money from the organization’s operational equation.

The benefits
The Labdoo founders decided to build the Project as a Zero Funding Organization because of several important reasons:
To run Labdoo, there is no need for money. The world has so much excess capacity (laptops, travelers, connectivity, goodwill, etc), that we have the capability to solve the digital divide problem without incurring any additional cost (economic or environmental).
By removing the money factor, the project's mission becomes clean and focused. This approach implies that there is no possible confusion on what the objective of the project is and it strengthens its values. The only possible motivation supporting the project is one of making a contribution to the global community.
This approach makes Project Labdoo resilient against global economic crisis. A paradox about our economic system is that when there is an economic crisis, social projects are the ones who get the biggest hits in terms of budget cuts. Hence, those that need the biggest help are the ones who get hit first and harder. This is so because of the money-dependency factor in practically all social projects. By removing the money from the equation, Labdoo can continue to operate normally even in the presence of economic recessions. In fact, Project Labdoo was created in the midst of one of the biggest economic recessions of the last 100 years.
Money does not teach global citizenship, global collaboration does. If we took the shortcut of soliciting and using lots of money to resolve our mission, then all right, we would solve the problem, but we would not learn anything along the way. It is the 'doing of things together', in collaboration, that teaches us all concepts like making our planet more sustainable and understanding that we are all part of the same global community helping each other.
The opportunity cost. If we invest $100 in bringing one laptop to a needy school, automatically we are des-investing $100 from all other humanitarian projects such as the provision of health care, clean water, shelter, etc. Let's use the money for those projects that really need it.
If we were a company, our best "marketing strategy" would be to advertise how low our costs are. In humanitarian aid, when it comes to choosing social projects, we believe people are very sensitive to the approach taken by the organization. If our costs were high, this would turn people off. If we keep our costs very low, that is an indication that we are taking the right approach, which helps to get more people on board.
It substantially simplifies the paperwork and the logistics of international cooperation. Could you imagine the headache of administering money donations for a project that operates in more than 100 countries?
It allows for exploring new and more sustainable ways to organize global communities toward solving global problems. We love to innovate and innovation happens in all possible fields, not just technology, but also in ways we organize our workflows. We see the zero funding target objective as innovation in terms of how humans can organize to achieve common objectives in the most possibly efficient way.
The 'how' can be more important than the 'what'. There is a famous sentence that was told once by a famous President: 'We choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard." This idea reflects a very important concept in human society: the destination you choose to target is important (the 'what' you propose to do), but the path you choose to get there (the 'how' you propose to get there) can be even more important. The reason is that it is the path to that destination that makes you stronger, as a person, as a team, as a society. By choosing to go to the moon, it is not so much what you achieve in reaching a planet that has barely any resources, but it is more about what you learn along the way as a team by attempting to go there together. Through that journey, many new technologies were invented that today we enjoy, and society became more united and encouraged to take positive action than ever before. A new generation of kids became fascinated with what we achieved together and they too decided to become astronauts, scientists, mathematicians, doctors... simply, good men and women. At Labdoo we take the challenge of bringing education to every child in the Planet as an opportunity to make each of us stronger and more united. By choosing the path of open global collaboration, we empower everyone to take action, to learn the skills and to discover the global citizenship character that it takes for all of us to succeed together as one. This intangible, the 'how' you do things, the path you choose to achieve your target, can often (if not always) be more important than the destination you are aiming at itself.
The meaning of targeting zero funding: Cost per Dootronic (CPD)

Of course in reality from time to time there will be unavoidable costs. For instance, let's say a hub is presenting the Labdoo idea to its community in a local event; there will be a need to build tools to help outreach and communicate. Perhaps there will be a need to create a roll up or to print your own outreaching cards. Because these costs are small, most labdooers tend to absorbe them out of their pocket (for instance, since most of us have printers at home, it costs practically nothing to print a few flyers). However, certain hubs grow to support a network of hub branches and as they organically grow, their fix costs increase too: e.g., it is not the same for a small hub at a high school to sanitize 20 laptops a year than for a few united hubs and branches to sanitize 1000 laptops.
The meaning of the words 'targeting zero funding' is not so much about the fix costs, but about the marginal costs of the project. The marginal costs are defined as the Cost per Dootronic or CPD. Our goal is to keep the CPD of the Labdoo project as nearly as possible to zero. While we understand that absolute zero is not feasible, we operate with the target to keep it as low as possible by leveraging the two pilars: (1) excess capacity and (2) global collaboration.

Today our CPD is about 3 dollars per dootronic (this includes all possible costs, including transportation). This makes Labdoo more than 100 times more efficient than other initiatives such as the One Laptop Per Child, which had an estimated cost of more than 400 dollars per computer. It is important to notice that this is the average cost per dootronic (summing up expenses divided by numer of dootronics). Occasionally a laptop may cost higher than this value, but by leveraging scales, the average stays low. The CPD can be kept low because Labdoo relies on collaboration and excess capacity. The CPD value includes all the associated costs such as sanitizing unused laptops, loading the education software using free open source technology, transportation using CO2-neutral dootrips, deployment and post-deployment services via the collaborative Labdoo Global Support Program. Our goal is to continue to keep this number as low as possible.

Labdoo is a humanitarian social network where everyone can participate. Organized according to their function, the network is composed of the following non-exclusive participating groups: the grassroots, hubs, edoovillages and beneficiaries.
All of Labdoo's general values, philosophy and principles described in this document apply also to all of Labdoo's participating groups.

The Grassroots
The grassroots are defined as anyone carrying out a “Labdoo act”, no matter how small. Examples of such acts are: tagging, sanitizing a laptop, making a dootrip, explaining the meaning of the “digital divide” and “electronic waste” to a friend, recycling a laptop, coding a portion of the social network, etc. Every person that is part of the grassroots defines a node in the Labdoo network. Each of these nodes is connected with each other using the Labdoo humanitarian social network (HSN). The delivery of the overall social mission is made possible through these connections, which provide an efficient and sustainable way to bring excess capacity to regions in need.
While the Labdoo tools are provided “as is”, everyone participating in the project is expected to behave according to good ethic and moral principles. Participants acting against the values and principles described in this charter can be removed from the Labdoo network.

Hubs
Everybody can be a participant in the Labdoo network by performing actions to help spread education around the globe. When one or more of the participants act together regularly, they can optionally create their own Labdoo Hub. A hub is mainly a group of people that get together from time to time to carry activities such as collecting and sanitizing unused laptops, organizing dootrips, recycling technology, or carrying out outreaching activities, among others. Hubs are flexible in that they do not need to carry out all of these activities, but just the ones that are appropriate to the skills of the people part of it. For instance, some hubs are just dropping points where people can bring their unused laptops which then get transported to other hubs where they get sanitized. Hubs are typically implemented in high schools, at home, in companies, in your local neighbor community, in any type of organized community.
When a hub is created, it receives a kit containing the following:
A hub space inside the Labdoo systems that allows for the management of donated devices, dootrips, edoovillages, etc.
The listing of the hub in the page www.labdoo.org/hubs to help it gain visiblity.
The rights to create new edoovillages.
A web album inside the hub space where pictures of the hub's activities can be uploaded.
If a hub becomes inactive for at least six months or if it acts against the Labdoo principles described in this charter, its kit can be removed or reassigned to another hub or group of people.

Edoovillages
Edoovillages are schools where laptops are deployed. Labdoo focuses on equipping schools because:
Schools have their own organized community.
Classrooms are managed by teachers which can help monitor the good use of the laptops. The role of the teachers is also important to help Labdoo recycle laptops once they no longer work.
Schools typically have electricity and access to the Internet (even in remote areas thanks to the expansion of wireless communications). They also provide water-proof and secure shelters.
Working with schools simplifies also the coordination of dootrips, as many travellers to poor communities visit schools in their trips.
In order to create a new edoovillage, the potential recipients will need to fill in the Labdoo laptop request form.
When an edoovillage is created, the recipients receive a kit containing at least:
An edoovillage dashboard from where the inventory of contributed devices can be managed and tracked.
An entry in the list of Labdoo edoovillages.
A web album inside the edoovillage space where pictures of the edoovillages activities can be uploaded.
To help reduce electronic waste, a main obligation of the laptop recipients is to report back to Labdoo.org every six months the list of laptops under their inventory and their status (working or not working) and facilitate the process of recycling the laptops once they no longer work through the Labdoo's social network-based recycling mechanism. This reporting processes are referred as Global Inventory Checks (GICs).
The Beneficiaries
Besides helping to eliminate the digital divide and thanks to its distributed nature, Labdoo can also help remove other types of social barriers. One example is the barriers and stereotypes that may exist between beneficiaries and the benefactors. In traditional aid systems, usually the rich helps the poor, the north helps the south, the adults help the youngest ones. In the Labdoo network, however, everyone can benefit from the project and everyone can make a contribution. The project aims at covering needs and mobilizing excess resources wherever they may be, regardless of their location and their size. For instance, in the Labdoo network, aid can originate from the developing world and be received by the developed world. Also, not only adults can participate with the tasks of sanitizing a laptop, but also young students. Real examples found in the Labdoo network illustrating this concept are a Labdoo hub created in Mexico City sanitizing laptops and a School in Silicon Valley receiving laptops for students coming from low income families.
In the Labdoo network there are no benefactors; instead, everyone is a beneficiary. Those who receive the technology benefit from it by having a better access to education while those that dedicate a moment of their time to bring technology to the needy ones benefit from the experience of participating in a global project, learning about the social and environmental issues the world faces, making new friends, and the joy of seeing a happy face at the end of their mini-mission.

Labdoo's Code of Conduct
Labdoo has earned its great reputation for trust and confidence because its volunteers hold to a higher standard by adhering to commitments, displaying honesty, integrity, respect, and conducting honorably.
Everything we do in connection with our work at Labdoo is measured against the highest possible standards of ethical conduct. Our commitment to these standards ensures that great people join our network, be they volunteers or partners.
The following document presents Labdoo's official code of conduct. This document helps us follow some guidelines on how to behave and how to handle different scenarios when interacting with other volunteers, NGOs, schools, companies, organizations and people in general.

Labdoo Glossary
Digital Divide: A global problem arising from the fact that those who do not have access to the Internet, cannot have free access to sources of education, which leads to lesser opportunities with respect to those who do have access to the Internet. Since those who have access to the Internet learn education at a much faster pace
than those who do not, the digital divide leads to an ever increasing socio-economic gap between these two groups.
Dootronic: An electronic learning device stored in the Labdoo database.
Dootrip: The action of transporting a laptop from one location to another in the luggage of volunteering travelers who have to undertake that trip regardless of the
laptops. Dootrips effectively provide a transportation system with no economic or environmental cost.
Edoovillage: A location where the Labdoo network has a school project where laptops are sent.
Electronic Waste (eWaste): A global problem arising from the ever increasing consumption of electronic goods that at the end of their life time do not get properly
recycled back to planet earth.
Hub: A hub is mainly a group of people that get together from time to time to carry Labdoo activities
Global Inventory Checks (GICs): A tracking system which can track deployed dootronic status. It can be used to quickly update all the dootronics assigned to an edoovillage in one shot.
Labdoo: It stands for Laboratories for Education—the mission of the Labdoo project is to use social network tools to bring laptops to children without incurring additional costs to Planet Earth.
Labdooer: A Labdoo activist.
Labdoo Global Support (LGS): A support system to provide online technical help to schools around the world who receive dootronics
Mini-mission: The mission of bringing a single unused laptop to a school so that children in that school can gain free access to sources of education.
Labdoo Circle of Life: It is the life-path that every laptop should undertake to ensure sustainability, including the extraction of its components from Planet Earth, their assembly into the actual laptop embodiment, its usage, its delivery to a child for education purposes using dootrips, and its final recycling back to Planet Earth.
Team: Labdoo provides a communication tool to help labdooers manage their own projects and activities in collaboration with other members. We call this feature "Labdoo teams".
Wiki: Wiki pages allow users share knowledge and best practices in document format.


Information for Dootrippers (Travelers)
Wiki Documents to Print
Before you travel with the laptops, it's important to check that your delivery package includes a printed copy of the "Dootronics Welcome Kit" inside an envelope. If your package does not include it yet, then please go to this page, where you will be able to download it and print it.
Managing Your Dootrips
The Labdoo Aid Social Network provides a set of dashboards to help you manage your dootrips and receive automatic notifications upon new correlated events. Please read the section about the Dootrips System under the general Labdoo Manual to learn more about how the dootrip technology works so you can make the best use of it when carrying out your mini-missions.
Transport, Customs, and Dootripper Letter
Before you travel, you need to know:
Number of laptops you can carry. Practically all countries accept people carrying 2 laptops without any problem. If you are carrying more than 2 laptops, we recommend that you check the customs rules of the specific country you are traveling to. If you plan on carrying more laptops than what the rules allow you to, distribute them equally among the people who are traveling with you. For instance, if you are carrying 6 laptops and you are traveling with 2 more people, have each person carry 2 laptops.
Check in the laptops. If you are flying, we recommend you to pack the laptops in the luggage that you will be checking in at the airport (instead of in your carry-on luggage). This way your laptop will travel all the way to the destination without you having to worry about it.
For a larger number of laptops, bring a dootripper letter. If you need to carry more laptops than what the customs rules allow, you will need to explain that the laptops are not for commercial use but for educational and humanitarian purposes. To do so, we recommend you to print the 'Dootripper letter' which you will find in the Labdoo Toolkit and to take it with you.
Batteries. Almost all laptop batteries are under 100 Wh and can be transported without any restriction in your checked luggage or in your hand luggage. If your battery wattage is under100 Wh, an approval from the airline is not required. Otherwise, please check the IATA rules at the time of your trip or feel free to pose a question to the Labdoo teams community: https://www.labdoo.org/teams. For the latest information, please visit directly: http://www.iata.org/lithiumbatteries.


Take Pictures and Upload them to the Photo Album
Tags: 
Remember to take a good amount of pictures of your trip. Pictures are important to keep the Labdoo platform transparent and open. They are the best way to demonstrate that the donated laptops reach their intended destination. Please make sure that the pictures:
(1) are of good quality.
(2) clearly illustrate the laptops and allow donors to recognize their contributed dootronic.
(3) clearly portray the students using the laptops in their classroom.
Make sure you upload the pictures to the photo album of the edoovillage you are visiting. If you don't have enough rights to upload pictures to the album, ask your edoovillage manager to grant you the necessary rights or send them the pictures so they can upload them for you. You will find all this information in your edoovillage's website. In this page you will find a detailed description of how to upload pictures to your album.


What to Do Once the Laptops are Deployed
Here is the check list of things to do once you have deployed the laptops in an edoovillage:
The following links will redirect you to a “how to start” wiki explaining how to use the Labdoo laptops. Tell the students and the teachers of the school where you are deploying the laptops about these wiki guides. If they don't have access to the Internet, print them (front and back to help save paper) and give them the printed copy.
- English: https://www.labdoo.org/content/how-start-labdoo-laptop
- German: https://www.labdoo.org/de/content/wie-starte-ich-den-computer
- French: http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/documents/french/labdoo-letter-recipient-...
- Spanish: http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/documents/spanish/labdoo-letter-recipient...
- Russian: http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/documents/russian/labdoo-letter-recipient...
Please ensure that the teachers and the students receive a copy of the 'Dootronics Welcome Package'. If they don't have it yet, remember that you can download it for them from this page.
It is specially important that you explain the teachers and the students in your edoovillage that they can use the Labdoo Global Support wall to resolve any of their technical questions. This is really necessary to ensure Labdoo can help them solve any question they may have. More information about the LGS program can be found in this page.
Since some edoovillages do not have access to the Internet, various languages and keyboard layouts are preinstalled and preset. Depending on the language the teachers and the children speak at school, you may want to change the default settings of your laptops. To adjust the language settings, read the instructions from this page.
The power plugs provided with the laptop may or may not match depending on the type used in the country where your edoovillage is located. If the power plugs do not match, they can be acquired from a local computer store at a very modest price. This table provides a list of standard plugs based on the different countries.
Labdoo laptops come preloaded with several Open Education Resources (OER) manuals in a large variety of languages that can be found in the folder '/home/labdoo/Public/'.
On each laptop desktop you will find a folder called 'videos' with a set of video tutorials for users and technicians.
Each laptop comes with 3 user accounts: 'labdoo', 'student' and 'guest'. For details refer to the how to start guide.
Often there are local Linux or Ubuntu User Groups (called LoCoteams) in the country of the edoovillages. These communities might help if there are any questions. You can find your nearest Ubuntu LoCoteam by going to this website and selecting your country: http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/. You can also use Google or any search engine to find and locate them.
Some of the laptops might come with a Windows system as a guest operating system on a VirtualBox (only if the requirements for a Windows license are fulfilled and if the laptop is powerful enough to host a virtual machine). Search for VirtualBox under the list of applications and, if it is available, you can launch a Windows virtual machine from this application.
Labdoo.org helpers invested a lot of time and effort to offer you and the children an optimal system. But we are all human and mistakes are unavoidable some times. If you have any suggestions to improve the Labdoo system, please inform us. We would like to know and learn from you. Please provide any feedback that you have by writing to the Labdoo Global Support wall.


How to Package a Laptop for Dootripping
The purpose of this packaging method is to make it easy for the traveler to open the package and take out the laptop, then seal it back together when it’s necessary.
Materials required:
laptop and Dootronic Welcome Package
bubble wraps, a thick black marker, wide packaging tape, scissors, scotch tape
Instructions:
1. Power on the laptop to check if it works properly. Remember to shut it down before packaging.
2. Check and make sure all the items (laptop + power adapter + battery) are labeled with the same Labdoo ID numbers.
3. Place the Dootronic Welcome Package on top of the laptop.
4. Place 2 layers of bubble wrap underneath the laptop. Cut enough bubble wrap to fully cover the laptop and leave 5-10 extra centimeters on one side.
5. Use the packaging tape to seal the center and then seal one side to create a bag shape. Make sure you leave enough space.
6. Add the power adapter and repeat step (3) and (4) to make the second bag. This time, seal the opposite side so that all 4 sides of the laptop are covered by bubble wrap.
7. Wrap a new layer of bubble wrap around the seal side of the laptop twice, cut it off, tape the end and label the edge as "cut-line".
8. Label the top of the package with the Laptop ID number.
Packaging the laptop Battery
9. If the laptop has a battery, remember to pack the battery separately. Please remember to label the battery with the Labdoo ID number as well.
10. Use the scotch tape or any easy-to-remove tape to secure the battery on the side of the laptop so the traveler can easily separate it from the laptop and carry it with them if needed.


Shipping Laptops in US via Postal Service
Sometimes it is difficult to find a hub that has laptops available close to the city where your traveler is leaving from. Since Labdoo does not accept monetary donations, we don't have the budget to pay for shipping costs. However, in the United States, Edoovillage has the option to use the online shipping provided by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to prepay the shipping and have the laptops delivered to the traveler. Here's how it works.
After the laptops are ready to be shipped, the Labdoo hub will provide you the following information:
From Address:
Package Weight:
Package Size:
Package Value:
Create a user account at http://www.usps.com. Click "Sign Up Now" and fill in your personal information.
Log in and select "Create a Label" under "Click-N-Ship".
In the "Where are you sending from?" section, click "Edit" and change the address to the "From Address:" provided by the Labdoo hub in Section 1.
Fill in the section "Where are you sending to?" with the address where laptops need to be delivered to.
In the section "Enter package details", select both "Enter Package Weight" and "This package has a dimension measuring over 12". Fill it in with the values "Package Weight" and "Package Size" provided in Section 1 accordingly.
Fill in the field "Package Value" with the value provided in Section 1. Scroll down and click on "Next Select a Service"
Click "Priority Mail" to select that option. (Adding insurance or extra services is optional.)
Click "Add to the Cart".
Fill in your payment information.
In the page "Print Your Labels", select "Save as PDF" to save the shipping label file.
Email the shipping label to the Labdoo hub so the hub can use the label to ship the laptops to you.



Information for Edoovillages (Schools)
Edoovillages are the schools where laptops are deployed. Labdoo focuses on equipping schools because:
Schools have their own organized community.
Classrooms are managed by teachers who can help monitor the good use of the laptops. The role of the teachers is also important to help Labdoo recycle laptops once they no longer work.
Schools typically have electricity and access to the Internet (even in remote areas thanks to the expansion of wireless communications). They also provide waterproof and secure shelters.
Working with schools also simplifies the coordination of dootrips, as many people who travel to poor communities visit schools during their trips.
In order to create a new edoovillage, the potential recipients will need to fill in the Labdoo laptop request form.
When an edoovillage is created, the recipients receive a kit containing at least:
An edoovillage dashboard from where the inventory of contributed devices can be managed and tracked.
An entry in the list of Labdoo edoovillages.
A web album in the edoovillage's space where pictures of the activities with the laptops can be uploaded.
To help reduce electronic waste, a main obligation of the laptop recipients is to report back to Labdoo.org every six months the list of laptops in their inventory and the status of those laptops (working or not working) and to facilitate the process of recycling the laptops once they no longer work through the Labdoo's social network-based recycling mechanism. This reporting processes are referred to as Global Inventory Checks (GICs).

Managing Your Edoovillages
The Labdoo Aid Social Network provides a set of dashboards to help you manage your edoovillages (e.g. inventory management, configuration of automatic notifications on new correlated events, photo albums, etc.). Please read the section about Edoovillages under the general Labdoo Platform Manual to learn more about how you can make the best use of the Labdoo tools.
Edoovillage Requirements to Receive Dootronics
a potential edoovillage needs to satisfy the following main requirements:
Since Labdoo focuses on 'spreading education', an edoovillage must basically be a school or an educational center. In some occasions we can make exceptions and provide laptops to other organizations like hospitals or clinics, but most of the accepted edoovillages are actually schools.
Edoovillages are asked to find travelers (dootrippers) willing to travel from any of the hubs to their location. This requirement is important to ensure the project is logistically viable. Labdoo is sending laptops to a very large number of schools, so having the schools themselves find the travelers helps speed up the implementation of the project and makes it feasible and sustainable. While Labdoo can also help find travelers, it is generally required that the school provides the first travelers on their own.
The school must be capable of keeping laptops in a secure place to ensure they won't be damaged by harsh climate conditions (rain, dust, heat, ...) nor stolen.
Once accepted, schools need to fill in the edoovillage request form and provide pictures of the school and the official school / NGO certificate in order to initiate the project.


Laptops with no batteries
Unless the battery is in good condition and can hold up charge well, we purposely remove the battery from the laptop.
There are several reasons for that.
1. The used battery that came with the used laptop is typically reaching toward the end of its
life cycle. Very often, the old battery causes problems to power up the laptop. (Tip: If you have a problem powering on the laptop or if there's a warning message about battery problems when you turn it on, try to remove the laptop battery to see if the problem goes away.)
2. Old batteries are one of the most poisoning eWaste items. Since many schools may not have the capacity to properly dispose of eWaste, removing the laptop battery helps reduce eWaste.
3. The laptop battery is quite heavy, and many airlines don't allow laptop batteries to be in the checked luggage together with the laptop. The volunteer has to carry the battery separately with their carry-on suitcase, which is an extra burden to the traveler.
Not including the old battery reduces the CO2 footprint and also eases the traveler’s life in a
great deal.
The Labdoo laptops are most often used in the classroom setting, and most of the classrooms do have power outlets. We decided not to include the batteries on the laptops we sent out unless the battery is in excellent condition.
You can find further information on why and how to dispose safely of old batteries in this article from thunderboltlaptop.com
We hope you found the above explanation useful, and we are looking forward to seeing you share pictures of your students enjoying the laptops.

Kiwix, Xowa, Kolibri Offline reader and tools for educational content
Labdoo computers come with preinstalled programs to read offline content, such as Kiwix. It allows you to access offline wikis and learning content without being connected to the Internet. Depending on the language, availability and size of the hard drive, Labdoo will have already preinstalled some learning content. Using the tools a lot of additional OER - Open Educational Resources, license-free learning content can be downloaded in different languages.



The programs mentioned below are already preinstalled on "cloned" Labdoo computers, mostly in the language of the target country. There may be more or less content, depending on the size of the disk-drive. They can be found:

locally on a Labdoo computer in the folder /home/labdoo/Public
online on the server of the tools developer
on our FTP server http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/wiki-archive/
Program	Descriptions	Program name	Screenshot
kiwix (since end of 2020)	Since end of 2020, cloned IT donations are coming with the Kiwix tool. In the folder /home/labdoo/Public/kiwix/wikis you will find preinstalled learning content (zim and meta files). Further learning content can be downloaded from the web. Note: All users these saved in the aforementioned folder, but these new folders must be opened once or else theis content will not appear on the list. To activate new contents for another user, click on the folder symbol at the upper right corner, navigate to the above folder and click on the content to activate it.
A great feature of Kiwix - if you click on the 3 dots (...) in the upper right corner, you can start the Kiwix server. An IP address is displayed and it can be used by other computers, cell phones or tablets to get connected, read the learning content on their devices and learn using it.	kiwix	
kiwix Add-On for Firefox (since end of 2020)	The preinstalled Kiwix add-on in Firefox will display zim archives for Kiwix. This allows you to access the zim archives with learning content in the folder /home/labdoo/Public/kiwix/wikis. However, this browser extension does not offer all the functions of the Kiwix app; the browser plug-in is still in beta phase.	kiwix plug-in Firefox	
Xowa (until end of 2020)	Until the end of 2020, Labdoo used Xowa as a tool to display offline wikis http://xowa.org/. Since then, Xowa was replaced by Kiwix to clone images.
If you want to continue using Xowa, you can install it, set it up manually and load wikis from the Xowa server yourself. Labdoo also removed the Xowa archives from its FTP server at the end of 2020. Instead, the most common zim archives for Kiwix are still available on our FTP server.	Kolibri	Another tool for offline content is Kolibri, based on mySQL database. It comes preinstalled, but not configurated.


Additional Programs
Program	Descriptions	Program name	Screenshot
alsamixer	The program alsamixer is a tool to access all ALSA settings provided for the sound card. Frequent settings, which cannot be directly accessed with the X-user interface, are deactivated or down-regulated. With Alsamixer you can quickly find and activate these settings.	alsamixer	
calibre	Calibre is a cross platform program to manage and convert e-books	calibre

ARandR	ARandR is a tool to configurate the monitor settings, e.g., a second monitor or a Beamer.	ARandR	
Audacity	Audacity is a free, open-source and easy-to-use graphical audio editor and recorder.	audacity	
KRDC	KRDC is a VNC client / desktop sharing application, compatible with RDC Remote Desktop for Windows. A remote computer can be operated using VNC. The screen content of another computer is displayed on the local computer. Mouse and keyboard entries are sent back from the local computer (here the client, also called the viewer) to the remote computer (the VNC server runs on the host).	krdc	
Virus scanner ClamAV (ClamTK)

Linux doesn’t normally need a virus scanner due to the Linux security concept. There are very few (not to say - none) viruses in Linux desktop. Nevertheless, some companies still offer virus scanner for extra security, for example to protect the file server being used by Windows clients.
Some edoovillages also request a tool to be able to scan a USB drive and remove any possible virus from it. ClamAv is recommended for this purpose (ClamAV is automatically installed if you are using the installation scripts or cloning images).
To serve the purpose, we recommend the license free, open-source virus scanner called ClamAV
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ClamAV (You can use ClamTK to start the program).

More modules and the virus signatures may need to be installed in order to run the program smoothly. Therefore, please run either the installation script for Labdoo FTP site ( http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/installskripts/installscript... ) or use the cloning images since all the programs are already preinstalled in the images.



Why Labdoo Uses Linux
If you receive Labdoo laptops, we strongly recommend to not overwrite the installation with Windows and to leave the installed Operating System Linux in place. There are many important reasons for that:
Linux is between 50-100% faster than Windows. Installing Windows can make your laptop much slower.
Linux is an open and free software. This is an incredibly powerful property. This basically means that people can freely use all the software provided by Linux without worrying about license violations. It means that you can fire up the Ubuntu Software Center and install any of its thousands of applications for free. This aspect is really important for schools and students, because it provides freedom to access powerful educational applications.
Many Windows versions are or will soon be out of support (XP, Vista or Windows 7). This means that they will no longer be maintained and updated. The laptop you are receiving is fully updated and patched with a long-supported version.
Labdoo's software comes with more than 300 educational applications in addition to the Firefox web browser, Skype, VLC, or the Libre Office Suite that offers all the Microsoft Office's functions.
Labdoo laptops come with more than 1,000,000 eBooks, videotutorials and Wiki Pages preinstalled, even in your local language. If you install another operative system, you will lose all this content
Labdoo supports through its Global Support Program (LGS) only the laptops that keep the original Labdoo software. You can find all the Labdoo video tutorials on the Desktop in the folder "Videos" and you can also find manuals in the folder "/home/labdoo/Public/how-to-start"
Separated user and permissions concept: The creation of 3 different users -Teacher (labdoo) Student (student) and Guest (guest) eases enormously the learning process and the sharing of the laptop between students.
You still can still use Windows applications through Wine and VirtualBox if you really need to, please continue reading below if you want to know how.
The Look and Feel of a Labdoo laptop is almost identical to that of a Windows machine. Because we understand that you may be used to Windows operating systems, we've tuned Labdoo laptops to have a very similar user interface.
If the above is still not convincing enough and if you'd like to install another operating system different than Linux to your Labdoo laptops, you can still do so. Labdoo does not impose any restrictions on the software you run on the computers provided that you can ensure that the laptops are being used for educational purposes.

If you want to change the operating system (OS) but the laptop needs to travel internationally, we recommend you to install the basic, license free Ubuntu in the laptop, and then you can have the edoovillage install their desired OS locally. A basic OS is needed to travel abroad because the international travel rules require laptops to be able to boot into an OS.
If the laptop does not travel internationally and you want to have your own OS, then it is recommended to deliver the laptop without any OS. Just format the hard drive by using the 'shred' command.
Please make sure all software and OS installed in Labdoo devices are NOT violating any copyrights or laws. As explained above, this is the reason Labdoo.org strongly encourages using open and license-free OS and software such as Ubuntu.

Use Windows under your Linux Laptop
If you need to run Windows applications, you can still use one of the following options with a Labdoo machine:
Wine is a free tool, enabling Windows applications (exe) to run on Linux. Using Wine you are able to run many programs on Linux, even those developed for the Microsoft Windows OS. Wine can be used without installing the Windows OS. Of course, you will still need to buy or own the necessary licenses for these programs. Read more here https://www.winehq.org/, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine.
Installing multiple operating systems using VirtualBox
If the laptop comes with more than 2 GB RAM, you can consider using Virtualbox, a tool that allows you to install another operating system like Windows next to (or on top of) Linux. By doing so, you will be able to run Ubuntu as the host OS and Windows, or other operating systems, as a guest OS at the same time.
You also need to fulfil the legal and license regulations on the guest OS that we mentioned above. The images provided by Labdoo for cloning laptops come with a preinstalled Virtualbox. There is also an installation script to install Virtualbox and its extensions for a Linux OS available.

How to Start a Labdoo Laptop?
User Accounts and concept
Each Labdoo laptop comes with the Ubuntu operating system preinstalled (release names: xx.04 LTS; xx = 2018, 2020 etc.) and with 3 users already created, ready to use:
student: is a standard user account for students. The user student is not administrator, just a standard user. The password for this user is labdoo (you can change the current password or not.)
guest: is an account which doesn’t require a password to log in. All data will be automatically erased after the user logs off from this account
labdoo: has super user rights / is administrator! labdoo is an administrator account and has all the access rights on the computer. Working under this account without a proper knowledge may crash the system! Therefore, it is recommended to have only teachers know the password of the user labdoo. The password is labdooadmin.
The letters of the password should match with the character set of the keyboard (latin letters and what you see on keyboard). Using other keyboards with, non-latin characters might lock you out of the computer.

Important: The keyboard layout can be changed manually at the time of log-in (see below). The system setting of the keyboard layout can be changed via the system file / etc / default / keyboard. Labdoo recommends storing the keyboard layout of the delivered computer in this system file (WYSIWYG).
User log in,
select user	Login Screen
Auswahl User
Select a
user language
(after log in)	 
Select a
keyboard layout	 
Settings for visually
impaired users (optional)	 
 


Important: the keyboard layout used when logging in will be set during the installation process of (L)Ubuntu. If you installed a computer using images for cloning this will be the German keyboard (DE). Otherwise, the keyboard layout used to install Ubuntu will be the one to remain. To change the layout after logging in, open a terminal (press Strg/CTL + Alt + T at the same time) and type sudo nano /etc/default/keyboard (press Enter). Next, change the keyboard code, (e.g., EN for English, FR for French, ES for Spanish etc.). You can optionally add the code of a specific country in the following line between the 2 quotation marks (z.B. CH for Switzerland). Then store the file (Strg/CTL + Alt + O (Enter), next Strg/CTL + Alt + X). You will NOT modify the keyboard layout you have used after having already logged in. This can be changed using the setting or the keyboard layout icon in the task bar.

Desktop MATE
The recommended desktop is MATE.
To Start a Program
There are many useful, fun and educational software and games installed. To start a program:
Click on the lower left corner on the Ubuntu icon (similar to Windows XP) → “Education” or "game“ → click on the program you want to start it.
In the folder “/Public”, you will find a lot of useful reference manuals, such as OER, Offline wikis, e-books etc.
The icons for a video tutorial and an offline Wikipedia (Kiwix) are available on the desktop.



Optional: Desktops (user interfaces)
Labdoo laptops come with Ubuntu (Linux operating system based on Ubuntu) and the MATE desktop. MATE is fast and easy-to-learn. They can be installed on older laptops with at least 2 GB RAM and they will still run fast (recommended: 4 GB RAM).
Adjust languages, regional formats and keyboard settings
Depending on the country where the edoovillage is located, you may want to install one or more additional language(s) or keyboard(s).
You can adjust the language settings by selecting Preferences → Language Support. You may get messages like “Language support not completely installed, install now”. Click on "Yes" and continue the installation.
In the next window select Install/Remove languages → select the language(s) needed → Apply → Apply System-Wide.
The new languages will show up in the language list (as shown above). Ubuntu will use the first language that appears in the table, then go to the next one, and continue. If no languages matched, English will be used as default language.
To change the priority of the languages → select and hold the right mouse button on the new language → move the language to its position and release the right mouse button → click "Apply System-Wide". The new language will be used after logging out and then logging in again or after rebooting the computer.


Regional formats
You can also adjust the local currency, notation of numbers, date and time, if available. Click on the tab “Regional formats“ and select the format as shown in the list → Apply System-Wide.

Keyboard settings
You may be able to skip this step if the laptop was cloned with images. Otherwise, you have to add a panel item to the task bar by clicking with right mouse button on the task bar → Add / Remove Panel Items → +Add → select "Keyboard Layout Handler" → +Add → optional: move the item position within the task bar by clicking "Up" or "Down".
Right click on the symbol "DE" (keyboard layout handler) in the task bar (another country abbreviation may be shown) → Keyboard Layout handler Settings → Remove the hook "Keep system layout", if activated, otherwise, you won’t be able to add new layouts) →
+Add → Add a new keyboard layout
-Remove → Remove a keyboard layout
↑Up → Move a keyboard layout entry in the list up
↓Down → Move a keyboard layout entry in the list up
The maximum number of keyboard layouts is 4.

Manuals, video tutorials and more
You can open the folder /home/labdoo/Public/ for more manuals, video tutorials, offline wikis, etc. The icon of a video tutorial is placed on the desktop. You can watch it by using Firefox or other media player (view -> 1/2 size, zoom +/-).

Install codecs for multimedia, film and DVD
If your computer was installed using an image for cloning you will find on each desktop a script installscript-codecs.sh. Legal Notice Patent and copyright laws operate differently depending on which country you are in. Please obtain legal advice if you are unsure whether a particular patent or restriction applies to a media format you wish to use in your country. Without executing this script, you will not be able to watch videos or DVDs.
This script will install restricted codecs and restricted software for multimedia applications. Proceed only if you are sure that you want to install these codecs and restricted software. Your computer must be connected to the internet while executing this script.

Programs for blind or visually impaired users
On the desktop you will find the icon of a magnifier. Click on it and you will get a magnifier which will follow your mouse. In the panel you will now see another magnifier icon. Right mouse click on that icon to open a settings menu.

Other programs for handicapped users are:
program	description	program name	screen shot
Orca	Screen reader; Wichtig: to toggle Orca on / off please press at the same time Alt + Super/Windows + o. To configurate Orca, open a terminal (User labdoo) -> type orca -s (Enter).	Orca	
pico2wave	Tool to read marked (high-lighted) text in any document. To toggle pico2wave on / off press the keys Alt + Super/Windows + p at the same time. Mark the text before, then press these keys and the text will be read out loud. If the piece of marked text is too long, an error will be reported.	pico2wave	
Elinks	Text-based web browser, running in a terminal (link on desktop).	Elinks	
More information on solutions for handicapped users can be found here https://www.labdoo.org/content/programs-handicapped-users-barrier-free.

Set volume
In the panel you will find an icon to mute or turn the volume up or down. Clicking on that icon will open a dialogue (mute, volume up or volume down). But there are much more settings for volume, microphone etc., which can only be accessed by a program called alsamixer:

Program	Descriptions	Program name	Screenshot
alsamixer	The program alsamixer is a tool to access all ALSA settings provided for the sound card. Frequent settings, which cannot be directly accessed with the X-user interface, are deactivated or down-regulated. With Alsamixer you can quickly find and activate these settings. Open a terminal (press Ctl/Strg + Alt + t at the same time), type alsamixer (enter). Now you can adjust the volume settings, move the keys ← → to move to the next channel, ↑ ↓ to turn the volume up or down.	

	
Printer settings, CUPS
A printer can be added and administrated by clicking System Tools → Printers → + Add a printer. Most printers, as far as they are connected to the computer or to network (LAN), will be recognized automatically.
For a more complex solution there is Cups (Common Unix Printing System), the most common print tool for Linux. Most printers can be used, jobs and spools administrated using CUPS. CUPS comes with an integrated web server. This server can be used to set up and manage a printer. Open a web browser and open: http://localhost:631. Only the user labdoo is allowed to access this page. In case a printer is locally connected to a computer you can allow access for another computer to this printer via LAN.

Help function F1, manual
By pressing the key F1 or help in the menu bar most programs will open a window and a manual for this program will show up.
Reset and restore user student
A student should log in as guest or as user student, but never as user labdoo (only teachers, administrators should use it). But even if you log in as user student, some menu bars or icons might be deleted by mistake. Everything can be "repaired", but you have to know how - and this knowledge might be missing at schools. But we offer a good solution for that - on the labdoo user's desktop you will find a script restore_user_student.sh (Double click to start the script, run in a terminal). But be careful! This script will delete every(!) data / document stored or reset every setting configurated since you received the laptop! So, make sure all data needed is assured! Sometimes this script is also helpful if you want to remove all of the data before giving the computer to another user.


Log in as administrator labdoo
labdoo: is administrator (admin, "Super User")! This means that the user labdoo has all access rights, e.g., for updating, installing additional software and educational content etc. But as the admin you can accidentally "destroy" the laptop so that it does not start and can no longer be used, especially when users have none or poor experience with IT and Linux. And if the computer is "destroyed", the closest Labdoo hubs who can help with a reinstallation or give support are far away. That could become a real problem.
Therefore, sign up only as user labdoo, if you act carefully and already have experience with the administration of computers. Otherwise, it is better to log in as user student, who has not the administrator rights, but can also use all programs and content - and has less chances to destroy a computer by mistake.
The password to log in is at delivery labdoo (for all systems being delivered with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or former releases, until about spring 2020). From Ubuntu 20.04 LTS ff. (starting about summer 2020) the password will change to labdooadmin. However, you should change this password immediately once you receive the computer at your school / project, because the user labdoo has administrator rights and only the teachers / maintainers and experienced users should have access as admins!




Dear Laptop receiver:
By receiving the above items, you are automatically accepting to abide by the following Labdoo global responsibilities:
(1) The items received will be used only for the purpose described by your organization at the time you solicited this donation. If you intend to use it for a different purpose, you will contact first the Labdoo team at contact@labdoo.org.
(2) In the case that an incidence occurs to any of the received items, you will contact the Labdoo team by going to https://www.labdoo.org/content/labdoo-global-support-lgs and writing on that wall your incidence, including the tagging number of the laptop(s) related to the incidence and a brief explanation. The following incidences must always be reported:
(2.1) At the end of the life of any of the received items, so that the item can be properly recycled.
(2.2) When an item breaks, malfunctions or in case there is any change in its status.
(3) Every six months, please write also a message to the wall at https://www.labdoo.org/content/labdoo-global-support-lgs with the list of laptops that you have and their status (working or not working). If we do not hear from you, Labdoo won't be able to provide more educational laptops and tablets for your project.
(4) Labdoo laptops are offered for free for educational purposes. In return, you agree to not use the laptops for commercial reasons and you agree not to charge any fee for the usage of the laptops.



Start a Laptop Request
The Labdoo guidelines do not allow to contribute computers to a specific person, only to organized public/private projects or schools, and the contributions have to stay within the edoovillage. All dootronics (laptops, tablets, etc.) are tagged via their online registration and have a unique Labdoo ID number.
To be able to accept a request, it's important for us to verify that the project is feasible and that there will be enough resources to successfully accomplish it. For instance, requesters and supporters should demonstrate to have travelers willing to carry the laptops to the destination (we call these dootrips) or otherwise demonstrate that there is a fair chance to find such traveling resources. All edoovilages are listed in this dashboard.
Please fill in the edoovillage request form that you will find in the Labdoo toolkit and send it over email to the Labdoo hub that will be taking care of your project. If you do not know your assigned hub yet, then you can use the Labdoo contact form to reach out to Labdoo. Send the request form together with pictures taken from the area, town, school and the children to one of our hubs.
Please reach out to us at least +/- 3-4 weeks before the departure of a traveler (dootripper), so we have time to prepare the laptops (dootronics).
Labdoo.org is only able to provide educational laptops because we receive them from donors around the world. It is difficult to tell in advance when the request will be fulfilled, but everybody can help shorten the delivery time by talking about the Labdoo project to friends, family, coworkers and their local community in general, or by talking to their local press and starting a call for laptop donations. There are many things you can do to help spread education around the world.

Homeschooling tools
Due to the Corona / COVID-19 situation, digital teaching / homeschooling is becoming more popular. As Labdoo receives an increasing number of requests for IT donations from schools and projects for students, Labdoo images are now coming with some of the below mentioned tools preinstalled or, if not, users can easily install those themselves. Most Labdoo's IT donations are delivered with the Labdoo learning environment based on Ubuntu / Linux (Images for cloning). To allow pupils' best usage of these donated computers, they can be integrated as seamlessly as possible into the school or web server environments of schools.


Microsoft Teams 365 Clients, Teams for Education, Microsoft Teams for Linux

If you want to install Teams yourself on another Linux computer: Download the above link to download the appropriate version to install for Ubuntu. deb, save the downloaded file on your computer, start the installation with a double click and follow the instructions.




Information for Labdoo Hubs (Laptop Collection/Sanitizing Points)
Labdoo is a global collaborative platform that operates in a decentralized and flat structure. Decentralization is essential to ensure sustainable and organic growth since hierarchies tend to generate bottlenecks and often add management overheads. Everyone is capable of taking actions in Labdoo regardless of ages or locations. You can help bring education to children and reduce electronic waste even if you only have 5 minutes or a few hours of spare time.
You can participate as an individual (for instance, by sanitizing your laptop once you no longer use it) as part of the grassroots. The individual contribution will go to a default hub called the Grassroots Hub. However, if you like to unite forces with friends and accomplish more, you can create your own Labdoo Hub. As a hub, you will have additional tools to help you manage your inventory and increase your presence within the platform to better outreach local and global communities.


Information for All Hubs
Let's start describing some of the activities you will be able to carry within your own Labdoo hub. Some activities may require technical experience, for example, hosting a sanitation workshop, but most activities rely on organization and leadership skill.
As part of a Hub you can choose to do any of the following activities. A best practice is to start with "outreach" and "collect and tag laptops" first, and then progressively increase as you gain experience. In any case, you decide which activities you can carry out depending on your resources, preferences and availability.
Outreach your community. Let people know about the digital divide and eWaste problems, and mobilize people to help the Labdoo cause.
Collect and tag laptops. Collect unused laptops from your local community and maintain your own laptop inventory.
Sanitation workshops. Get together with friends and members of your hub, sanitize unused laptops, install Ubuntu and the education software, and package dootronics ready to go on a new mini-mission.
Dootrips. Organize your own dootrips by mobilizing travelers in your own area.
Create edoovillages. Identify schools that need laptops and set up new edoovillage projects with them.
Recycle Laptops. Recycle laptops that no longer work and help reduce eWaste.


Tools That You Receive When Creating a Labdoo Hub
These are some of the tools you receive when you create your own hub:
Your own hub page. This page provides information (such as the location of your hub) to help donors know where they can bring their unused dootronics. From this page, you can also manage your own inventory of dootronics and edoovillages.
Photo album. Every hub has its own photo album where hub managers can upload pictures of their own Labdoo activities. To access the album, click on the "Go to photo album" button found in the hub page.
Additional user rights. As a hub manager, your user account will be given additional management rights within the Labdoo platform, such as the rights to edit your hub information or the rights to create your own edoovillages.
Tools to help organize your own outreaching activities. These tools include brochures, flyers, posters, email templates, etc. to help you initiate and manage your own campaigns to mobilize unused laptops and contributions from volunteers near your area. These tools include also the capability to create your own regional Labdoo newsletter and organize local events.
Additional management tools. For instance, as a hub manager you will be able to set regional triggers to automatically receive notification emails upon certain Labdoo actions happening near your area (such as laptop tagging activities or registration of new trips near your area).
Figure. Every hub has its own page to help outreach the local community and manage its own inventory. Each page has access to open data including the list of dootronics, edoovillages, and progress metrics.


Sample Sanitation Workshop
When you carry a laptop sanitation workshop, it's a good practice to organize your own workflow to ensure there is a proper coordination of the various tasks among your team members. While there are many different ways to do this and you can certainly be creative, here is a sample sanitation workshop template that you can use as a reference.
Sample Meeting Agenda
(Prepare to reserve between 2-3 hours to efficiently carry out a successful workshop.)
* Welcome and Sign-in - 15 mins
* Short Presentation and Status update - 15 to 30 mins (optional)
* Divide volunteers into groups to work on different tasks - one hour
* Clean up and Feedback - 15 mins.
Sign-in
Although there's no foreseeable danger involved for sanitizing laptops, and Labdoo, as a registered nonprofit, is protected by the laws, we still recommend you to have your volunteers sign a waiver form to release liability in order to avoid unnecessary disputes during or after the event.
Presentation
It is nice to remind our volunteers about Labdoo's mission and share the results of their hard works. Here's a few nice resources
About Labdoo Page https://www.labdoo.org/content/about-labdoo
Labdoo Facebook Page http://www.facebook.org/Labdoo
It is also important to encourage a new Labdooer to sign up a Labdoo User Account so he/she will be able to access all assistance listed at the Get Started page.
Divide the workshop into mini tasks
It is recommended to divide the working area into different stations based on number of attended volunteers and their skill level.
Please find possible mini tasks your volunteers can take during the workshop at the "Workshop Mini Tasks" page
We are keen to hear how you organize your events in order to build a better wiki knowledge and share with everyone. Please kindly share your experience by going to Team Wiki and Translations and click on start conversaion at the side menu, so we can incorporate your input into the current flow. Thank you.

Labdoo Volunteer Waiver
Depending on the region where you are, some Labdoo hubs like to distribute a waiver to the volunteers attending their sanitation workshops. Feel free to use this as a sample.
Volunteer, ___________________________, AKA (The Volunteer), email:_________________________ & Organization, Labdoo , AKA (The Organization), located at 92 Corporate Park, Ste. C303, Irvine, CA92606
I, the above listed Volunteer, desire to work as a volunteer for the Organization and I hereby voluntarily, execute this Volunteer Waiver under the following terms:
I, the Volunteer, release and forever discharge and hold harmless the Organization, its successors, and assigns from any and all liability, claims, and demands of whatever kind or nature, either in law or in equity, which arise or may hereafter arise from my volunteer work with the Organization.
I understand that this Waiver discharges the Organization from any liability or claim that I, the Volunteer, may have against the Organization with respect to bodily injury, personal injury, illness, death, or property damage that may result from my participation on the Organization’s activities. I also fully understand that the Organization does not assume any responsibility for or obligation to provide financial assistance or other assistance, including but not limited to medical, health or disability insurance, in the event of injury, illness, death or property damage.

(or Parent/Legal Guardian if the Volunteer
is under 18)
Date
I am of legal age and am freely signing this agreement. I have read this form and understand that by signing this form, I am giving up legal rights and remedies.


Workshop Mini Tasks
It is sometimes difficult to keep all attendees feel involved during the workshop, therefore, we prepare this possible mini-tasks list to help you get started. Please feel free to adjust according to the number of your attendees and their skill level. If the members are not technically strong, you can always contact us for help on "Installation and Repair" tasks after laptops are done with cleaning and tagging. We can help connect you with other technical hubs which you can send the laptops for future works.
A good preparation before the workshop is very important for carrying a successful workshop. Please be sure all the necessary supplies are available ahead of time. It is a good idea to have a box to keep all the supplies to bring to the workshop and periodically refill the box when supply is low.
We also find it is useful to color-code each laptop depends on the laptop's progress in the sanitation workshop. This gives flexibility and visibility on the laptop status especially when there are a lot of laptops to work on.
Here's a sample color-code we use:
White- passed inspection
Blue- has been tagged with Labdoo ID number
Yellow - data has been erased
Green- Labdoo image has been installed (We normally change language setting and do the final inspections after an edoovillage has been assigned to the laptop)
Red - the laptop is broken.

Station 1: Laptop Inspection (workshop mini tasks)
Purpose: To prescreen the donated laptop to avoid wasting time working on broken laptops
Supplies required: Universal Laptop Power Adaptors.
Work Description:
1. Matching the laptop with its power adaptor. If the laptop does not come with a power adaptor, use the universal power adaptor to check if the laptop can be power on.
2. Make sure the laptop can be power on normally.
3. If it is a defect laptop, add a red sticker with a note specified the problem (eg. cannot be power on or broken screen), and send it to the Repair Team

Station 2. Tagging laptops (workshop mini tasks)
Purpose: To ensure each working laptop has an assigned Labdoo ID number
Supplies required:
Blank Labdoo Label Sheet (you can find the link HERE), scissors, clear tapes, pens
Work Description:
1. Follow the Laptop Tagging procedure to tag the laptop. ( https://www.labdoo.org/content/tagging-laptop-labdoo-id-number )
2. Make sure both power adapter and laptop are tagged with the same number. If the laptop comes with a battery, please label the battery too since the battery may need to be carried separately from the laptop during the trip.
3. Add a blue sticker on the laptop.

Station 3. Software Installation (workshop mini tasks)
Purpose: To erase previous data stored in the laptop and install new Labdoo image.
Supplies required:
The Labtix CDs/USBs, Most current Labdoo Images (https://www.labdoo.org/content/preparation-fast-installation-methods)
Work Description:
It is recommended to separate Data Erasing and Software installation into two different meetings since erasing data is very time consuming (30 mins. - 1 hour)
1. Use Labtix to erase data. The instructions can be found Here. Apply a yellow sticker after data erasing.
2. Follow the Sanitation Guide for software installation
https://www.labdoo.org/content/sanitation-guide-fast-restoration-method-...
3. Add a green sticker after installation. If the laptop fails to be installed, add a red sticker with a note specified the problem and send it to the Repair Team for further investigation.

Station 4: Laptop Repair Team (workshop mini tasks)
Purpose: To assign skillful volunteers to investigate problems on broken laptops
Supplies required:
Since the Repair Team needs to be experienced volunteers, we expect each member comes with his/her basic toolkit - a universal power supply, screwdrivers for laptops, Labtix and Labdoo Image HD
What is also needed - small sealable bags for spare parts, extra memory and hard drives removed from broken laptops
Work Description:
1. Debug and fix the problems

Workshop Feedback Form
Some hubs use this template to collect monthly feedback from their team members. Feel free to use it too.
Labdoo monthly meetup feedback form:
Date
1) What were your main takeaways from today’s meeting?
2) How can you apply what you learned today for your team?
3) If you could change today’s meeting, what would you have done differently to make it more useful to you and your team?

Information for School Hubs
Labdoo hubs can exist in many different places (at your home, at your work, as part of your NGO work, etc.). This wiki section is dedicated to hubs which are created within the premises of a school.
Labdoo School Hubs consist of Labdoo Hubs that are run by students (for example, at a high school) with the supervision of adults.
Managing a Labdoo School Hub provides an excellent leadership opportunity for students.
As a Labdoo School Hub manager, we expect you to follow the Labdoo Hub rules. Please read the following sections with care. The information can help you make the best decision during the process of creating and managing your School Hub.


Where Can I Start?
The following instructions can help you start and maintain a Labdoo School Club
Remember, regardless of the cause, commitment and good communication are crucial to lead a successful social project and help the community. If you are decided to create a Labdoo Hub in your school, the following steps will guide you through the process:
1. Check with your school for the requirements to form a school club.
2. Invite friends to fulfill the club officer roles.
3. Find a teacher to be your club advisor.
4. Email us at contact@labdoo.org. We will find a parent hub to work with you. The parent hub can guide your club activities.
5. Read Responsibilities of a School Hub Manager page.
6. Submit the School Hub Information Form and Labdoo School Hub Officer Application to your parent hub manager.
7. Parent hub will need to supervise and evaluate the sustainability of the school hub before formally adding it to the Labdoo Hub list. Please keep periodic communication with your parent Labdoo hub manager.


Benefits offered to school hub members
Be environmentally friendly: Learn the best practices for recycling your electronic waste(eWaste)! It is easy to forget sometimes that our electronics need to be properly disposed, just like anything else. At Labdoo, you get to learn how you might implement these practices in your own life.
Help bridge the digital gap:  Have you ever imagined what it would be like to have the whole world connected digitally?  Students get to help deliver technology to underprivileged communities
Build critical thinking and leadership skills: Being in Labdoo is all about coming up with new ideas to deliver education and technology in a green way. Students get to think outside the box.
Build technical experience: Each mini-mission teaches students how to sanitize a laptop and install Edubuntu (an education package built on top of a Linux-based operating system).
Fulfill school service requirement: Many schools encourage their students to volunteer outside their centers. Students are required to spend a minimum time to serve the community. The time contributed to Labdoo can often be used towards fulfilling these service hours. Please contact your school first to see if Labdoo fits into their requirement.
Be a global citizen: Labdoo is a global non-profit social network. Labdoo volunteers are taught different skills and experience many cultural backgrounds. The Labdoo community provides many opportunities to interact and learn from other volunteers across the globe.


Ideas to work with your hub members
At Labdoo, the imagination is boundless. You can be creative and help in many different ways, from laptop donation to delivery of the laptops. Here is a small fraction of possible mini-tasks you can take quick action on.

Introduction to the Labdoo Project.
Help hub members get familiar with the Labdoo process (e.g., describe the state workflow S0 through S6).
Get familiar with the Labdoo platform (e.g., Labdoo teams, the wiki system, etc.).
Outreach to Community for Laptop Drives.
Reuse – Discover idle laptops around you and put them to better use.
Repurpose – An old laptop can have a new story. It can help provide education resources for underprivileged children.
Recycle – By properly recycling a laptop, 41 lbs of carbon emission will be prevented from entering the atmosphere. This is equivalent to recycling 270 soda cans.
Spread awareness among family and friends.
Set a goal on the number of laptops to be rescued for the semester.

I have a labdoo question
if you have any questions that do not get answered, please post them directly in any of the Labdoo Teams and one member of the Labdoo community will provide an answer.

Collecting sanitizing and delivering laptops

How to Find and Collect Unused Laptops
The first step in the Labdoo process is to identify an unused laptop that can be repurposed for educational means. There are many different ways to identify and rescue laptops that are no longer used. Here are some ways to do so, among others:
Reach out to your relatives, some of your family members may have an unused laptop.
Ask your neighbors, it is also likely someone around you has one or more unused laptops.
Contact the IT department at the company you work for, in many cases laptops are unfortunately thrown away when they are replaced.
Make a post on your favorite social network asking your friends and contacts for unused laptops.
Get creative and come up with your own strategy to find unused laptops, odds are that you will succeed. After all, more than 500 million computers are retired every year all over the world!
Remember that Labdoo will only accept laptops that have at least 1GB of memory RAM and that actually work (the easiest way to check if it does is to turn on the laptop and see if it is running). Otherwise, the laptop would not be suitable for educational purposes and can't be accepted. Note also that even if the battery does not work, the laptop can still be used and accepted as a valid contribution, since it can be plugged in the power source as any other computer. Finally, it's important to make sure you also collect its AC adapter and power cord.


Tagging a Laptop
Once you have collected an unused laptop, you need to register it into the Labdoo platform so it can receive a Labdoo ID number. The laptop status gets to be updated when it transits into the next step of the Labdoo process via this unique Labdoo ID number. Users can use it to trace the progress of the laptop. It also helps the hub managers to plan for their resources.This provides transparency and accountability in the Labdoo process.
If you haven't done so yet, start by creating your account in the Labdoo platform by following this link: https://www.labdoo.org/user/register
Click on the "Dootronics" menu that you will find at the top of the page and then click on the option "Tag it!". (Make sure you are logged into your Labdoo account to be able to access this page). Fill in the form with as much information about the laptop as you can, and then click on "Save".
All the questions ended with a "*" are required fields that you cannot leave blank. If you cannot find the serial number on the laptop, type "unknown" in the field.
If you are tagging the laptop on behalf of someone else, please fill in the field "Additional notification emails" with that person's email address so that they get email updates every time the laptop's state changes as it makes its way to a destination school.
After saving the form, it is very important to click on the link "Print tags". A new screen with the tags will show up. Print them and don't forget to attach them to the laptop to make sure it can be properly traced as it makes its path towards a project. See this diagram illustrating how the tags should be attached.
Figure 1. To tag a laptop, go to 'Dootronics' and click on the menu option 'Tag it!'.


Sanitizing a Laptop
Creation of a Labtix Bootable USB
1. Download Labtix.iso
Start by downloading and installing the FileZilla FTP client application from this link: https://filezilla-project.org/
Then, open FileZilla and connect to the Labdoo FTP server using these parameters:
Host: sftp://ftp.labdoo.org (this link can only be open once in FileZilla)
User: labdoo
Password: labdoo
Port: 22
In the 'remote site' window of FileZilla, go to the folder /install-disk. In this folder, you will find the file Labtix.iso. Right-click on this file with your mouse and select the option 'Download'. That way the file Labtix.iso will be downloaded to your local computer.
2. Create a bootable USB with Labtix.iso
Download the Universal USB Installer from this link: https://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/
Run this application by double clicking on the downloaded file. You will see the following screen, where you will need to accept the license agreement:
Next, insert a blank USB pendrive into one of the USB ports in your computer. We recommend to choose one with at least 2GB of storage. Note that all the data you had previously saved in the pendrive will be erased, so make sure to have a backup copy.
Then, fill in the fields in the next screen by using the parameters that appear in the next figure. As the screenshot shows, in the field Step 2 please select the Labtix.iso file previously downloaded and then select the corresponding USB pendrive in Step 3:
Continue by accepting every following screen
That's it. Now you have a bootable USB pendrive with the Labtix ISO. Go to the next wiki page to continue with the sanitation process.
Downloading the Labdoo Images
tep, you will need an external hard drive where you will be downloading one or more Labdoo images from the Labdoo FTP server. We recommend choosing a hard drive with at least 100GB, although one with a larger capacity (e.g., 200GB, 500GB or 1TB) would be even better in case you wanted to download some of the larger images.
Start by connecting again to the Labdoo's FTP server using FileZilla (see the previous section for a description on how to do this).
Then, go to '/'. In this location, you will find multiple directories of the form XX_images, where XX indicates the language of the image. Each of these directories contains multiple images organized by size. For instance, inside the English images directory 'EN_English_images', you will find the directory 'PAE64_20_04_LTS_EN_160'. The name of this directory lets us know that we are facing a (PAE) 64-bit image based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, with English as the default language and with a total of 160GB of educational content. The size of the file, 160GB in this case, corresponds to the minimum size that the hard drive must have in order to be able to store this image.
Make sure that, in the field 'Local site' , you select the external hard drive where you want to download the images.
Now go ahead and download the image that you are interested in. For instance, if you are interested in downloading the image 'PAE64_20_04_LTS_EN_160', the one we mentioned above, travel to the directory '/install-disk/EN_English_images/', right-click on the directory 'PAE64_20_04_LTS_EN_160' and select the option 'Download'. The image will be automatically downloaded to your external hard drive. Download as many images as you need, provided that you have enough space in your external hard drive. Note that the process of downloading one or more images could take a significant amount of time, depending on the speed of your connection.
Installation of the Labdoo Image Using Labtix
Plug the Labtix Bootable pendrive into one of the USB ports of the computer that you want to sanitize. Start the computer and verify that the Labtix software boots correctly. If it does, the following screen will show up:
If you don't see the screen shown above, it most likely means that you need to modify the boot order to make sure the computer properly loads the Labtix software stored on the USB pendrive. In this case, please follow the instructions on this wiki page to change the boot order of the computer and ensure that the USB pendrive is selected as the first boot device. After doing this, reboot the computer and, if the screen shown in figure 1 finally appears, you will know that Labtix is correctly booted.
Upon reaching the screen, select the first option "antiX" and press enter. This will take you to the next screen:
Once in this view, double-click on the icon 'Labdoo installer'.
Note that in the upper-right corner of the screen you will see a summary of the key parameters extracted from the laptop. It includes the following information:
Vers: the version of the Labtix software that you are using. In Figure 2, this value is '1.01'.
CPU: the type of CPU (32-bit or 64-bit). In Figure 2, this value is '64 Bit'.
Boot: The name of the booting USB device where Labtix is running. In Figure 2, this value is 'sr0'.
RAM: The amount of memory in the laptop. In Figure 2, this value is '2703' MB.
Sdx: The name of the hard drive where the Labdoo image is to be installed and its size. In Figure 2, the name of the disk is 'sda' and it has '100GB' of storage.
In the screen shown in figure 2, make sure to enter the name of your computer's hard drive. This name is typically of the form Sdx (for instance, sda, sdb, sdc, etc.), but not necessarily; it depends on your computer. The actual name can be found in the 'Sdx' field located in the upper-right corner of the screen. For instance, in Figure 2, the name of the hard drive is 'sda'. To be sure that it is in fact the actual hard drive of your computer, you can double-click on the application GParted, which will show you all the drives attached to your computer.
Click on OK to go to the next screen:
In this screen, you will need to specify the following parameters:
Shred: This option specifies the number of times the hard disk must be shredded prior to initiating the installation of the image. The operation of shredding consists in writing random zeros and ones everywhere in the hard drive to ensure any prior personal information is completely erased. Labdoo recommends setting this value to 3, so that three full shreds are carried out, ensuring that all existing information is erased.
Target disk: This corresponds to the name of the hard drive that you introduced in the previous screen (see Figure 2), which is the disk where the image will be installed.
Disk size: This field specifies the size of the chosen disk. This size will determine what image you can install, since you can't select an image larger than this value. For instance, in Figure 3, the size of the chosen disk (sda) is 100GB, so you need to make sure you don't install an image that is larger than 100GB.
Choose an image: In this step you will select the image to install. Click on this field, then select the option "Other...", and browse through the directory tree to select the image you want to install. In the directory tree, make sure you go to the external drive where you installed the images, and travel to the directory where you stored the image you want to use. Then, click "Open". This will populate the field "Choose an image": with the right path to your selected image. As mentioned in the previous parameter, make sure that the image you select is smaller than the size of the disk shown in the parameter "Disk size". By convention, the last value of the image name corresponds to its size. For instance, the image PAE64_20_04_LTS_EN_80 weighs 80GB, so you will need a disk with at least 80GB of storage.
Hostname:This field corresponds to the hostname that will be assigned to the computer after the image has been installed. By convention, please always choose a name of the form 'labdoo-XXXXXXXXX', where XXXXXXXXX is the 9-digit Labdoo ID of the computer you are sanitizing, which you had previously generated in the section 'Tagging a Laptop'.
After you have populated all the parameters above, click "OK" on all the following screens. Then the actual process of shredding and installation of the selected Labdoo image will initiate. Note that this process could take a while, even more than an hour, depending on the size of the disk and the size of the selected image.

Delivering Laptops to a Project
The third and last step is delivering the laptop you sanitized in the previous step to an educational project. To complete this process, do as follows:
First, check if there is an existing project near your location. You can see the full list of projects in this dashboard. If you find a project near your area, reach out to them directly by using the contact information you can find in that project's dashboard. Ask them if they need an additional laptop and if they would be willing to accept your contribution.
If you don't find any existing project near your location, try to find a school or a mentoring association nearby that works in the area of education. Some examples of valid organizations are: schools, associations working with refugees or, more in general, any organization that provides schooling or mentoring services to those who don't have access to education. If you find one, ask them if they need laptops and if they would be willing to accept your contribution. If the answer is yes, then reach out to the Labdoo team by filling in this form. A Labdoo volunteer will reach back to you and help you create this project.
Once you have completed any of the two steps above, you can now deliver the laptop to the chosen project. Finally, make sure to update the status of your laptop to S4 and assign it to the corresponding project. (If you don't know how to update the status of your laptop to S4, see this wiki page.)


Additional Info on how to Sanitize a Laptop
Labdoo recommends installing by cloning images with the free installation tool Labtix, developed by Labdoo helpers. As you could see in the video tutorial, there are numerous setting and selection options to adapt Labtix to your requirements.
Since Ubuntu version 20.04 LTS (April 2020), there are only 64 bit versions as hybrid images that can boot in both legacy and UEFI mode. To install current Ubuntu images, however, Labtix version 2 had to be adapted.
Labtix is regularly developed further. Please check our FTP server regularly for updates http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/Labtix/.
32 bit versions of the images cannot be installed with Labtix 2 anymore. If you still want to work with the old 32 bit images you have to use Labtix 1. However, neither the 32 bit images nor the installation tool Labtix 1 will be maintained further. For the 32 bit Ubuntu versions the support of the developers has also expired. More about Labtix 1 on https://platform.labdoo.org/de/content/labtix-1-archive.
Version	Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (64 Bit)	Ubuntu 22.04 LTS	Linux Mint 22 (based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)
Labtix 2			
Labtix 3			
Support Ubuntu bis	2025	2027	2029
Note for advanced users: Labtix has a persistence mode, i.e. you can make your own changes to Labtix and save them. You act as root user in fact. The password (only needed if you "get stuck" in the terminal when booting ) is "labdoo". But beware - as root you can destroy Labtix or bloat it by too many changes. Labtix fits on a CD when delivered. The tool ISO-snapshot also allows you to create a new ISO-file that takes over possible changes to the system.
Labtix comes with various tools and installation tools https://platform.labdoo.org/en/content/preinstalled-tools-labtix.
Most of them can be found directly on the desktop. You have to decide for yourself which tool suits you best:
You can find the installation tools directly in the context menu of zzzFM:

Labdoo installer for cloning the hybrid images that boot in legacy and UEFI mode,
Labdo legacy installer for a pure legacy installation if a device has problems booting a hybrid installation.
On the Labtix desktop you will find a Docs folder containing manuals in PDF format. However, we recommend that you first watch the individual steps and tools as a YouTube video tutorial.
Sometimes you have to select certain settings in the boot menu because of the hardware, e.g. with netbooks or Apple laptops often failsafe mode etc. Otherwise it can happen that Labtix does not boot, hangs at terminal level (the desktop does not appear) or the monitor remains dark.
Then try out the options in Failsafe Mode or Safe Video Mode. This is also explained in the above YouTube tutorial.
You can find all video tutorials on our YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/user/LabdooDACH/playlists and on our FTP server http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/Public/videos/for-technicians/.

Labtix 2 Desktop
current version: http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/
Labtix 2 (from 2022)
Since its launch in 2017, Labtix has become the most popular installer and remover tool within the Labdoo project. Labtix Release 1 is based on a 32-bit Antix 17 (2017) kernel. Labtix 2 is based on a 64-bit Antix 21 (2021) kernel.
Don't put Labtix 1 too far away as this "old" version works well with "old" hardware. And the new Labtix version 2 fits the more modern your donated laptop is, which requires current drivers that are only available in 2. And cloning images of 22.04 LTS and higher Labtix 2 is mandatory.
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS introduced a new boot partition format (grub2 core.img). Labtix 1 and also older Clonezilla versions do not know this format and therefore cannot clone current images on Ubuntu 22.04 and higher! Please try whether Labtix 2 starts with a setting such as failsafe or safe graphics if there is a problem. Then there would be Parted Magic as another installation tool on the web. Or you would have to take Labtix 1 and an image based on 20.04 LTS.
However, we recommend using Labtix 2 by default as it comes with many improvements and features:

Labtix 2 is based on Antix 21 and is only available in a 64-bit version. There is no longer a 32-bit version (sorry). Users who require a 32-bit version must use the earlier Labtix 1.
The images provided by Labdoo on our FTP server can be processed with either Labtix 1 or Labtix 2.
You need for Labtix 2
At least one 2GB USB key (recommended) or DVD to install and run Labtix 2 on. It is not possible to install Labtix 2 on a CD or a 1GB stick (too small).
min. 1.5 - 2 GB RAM in the computer to be installed.l
Labdoo team has changed the user interface as little as possible, so you don't need long training. Some changes were mandatory, e.g. Labtix 2 comes with the file manager zzzFM (Fork of SpaceFM). And 4 years of software development have passed...
Standard installation from the context menu of zzzFM with the Labdoo installer which performs a legacy and UEFI bootable (hybrid) installation,
Legacy installation with the Labdoo legacy installer from the zzzFM context menu for devices that cannot boot with Labdoo's hybrid installations.
The images provided by Labdoo on our FTP server can be processed with Labtix 1 up to 20.04 LTS and with Labtix 2 from 22.04 LTS.


From summer 23, only Labtix 2 will allow you to install the new smaller BASIC images and the desired content at the same time. If installed otherwise, the content can be added in Labdoo using the script.
UEFI (only for technicians): The number of IT donations with UEFI will increase. Normally you turn off UEFI and Secure Boot in the BIOS and enable Legacy Boot. However, there may be reasons why this is not possible (e.g. BIOS locked by unknown password; no legacy support implemented, etc.). There was already a manual UEFI procedure in Labtix 1, in Labtix 2 it is now largely automated. Labtix shows which mode (Legacy or UEFI) was booted in and you select the appropriate installation script in the 2-click installer in the file manager. If you select the UEFI Sprit, this happens: On the installation medium, the folder /UEFI with the UEFI image must be in the top folder. This small UEFI image is automatically installed first, followed by the actual image you want. After the installation, the UUID of the 2nd partition is entered in the grub file so that the computer starts up correctly. Labdoo had to decide to either maintain 2 complete sets of images (UEFI and legacy), which would have taken a lot of time and storage space on our servers. Or to have only one set of images (legacy) with the above solution, which is still started correctly in connection with an upstream UEFI image. Sounds more complicated than it is, everything is set automatically during installation.

Improved user support and more tools available:
Remaining battery capacity: Labtix shows the percentage (%) of the remaining battery capacity (life cycle), e.g. 20% means that only ⅕ of the original battery capacity is available and a new battery should be considered.
Better support for SSDs
New driver for current hardware (graphics card, interfaces, LAN/WiFi etc.).
Additional tools: Speaker test, Live USB Maker, Avahi network scan, StressCPU (°C/°F check), DiskCheck and much more.


Images for Cloning:
A new set of images for cloning based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS was made available and uploaded to our FTP server in mid-2022,
the 20.04 LTS based images are moved to the /archives directory on the FTP server,
The 18.04 LTS images need to be removed from the FTP server due to the capacity of the FTP server (those were the last images that could run on a 32-bit CPU; thus ending the 32-bit range for the Labdoo project) .
From summer 2023, only small “BASIC” images will be used for the respective languages. The content is then installed in Labtix by the installers. The large images that contain content will continue to be created for a while, but will be phased out in the long term.
Any image release can be processed with any Labtix release, fully compatible.


In order to start Labtix or Labdoo, settings in the UEFI may need to be changed. UEFI has replaced the old BIOS system, but can usually still be used in the same way as the old BIOS interfaces.
UEFI Settings
On some laptops it is necessary to change UEFI settings:
BIOS settings
On some laptops it is necessary to change BIOS settings:
BIOS Settings	Explanation
Secure Boot	Must always be turned off (disabled). Sometimes an administrator password must be set in the UEFI to deactivate Secure Boot. The admin password can then be removed again. Labtix does not start in secure boot mode but shows secure boot mode in the boot menu. In rare cases, however, an externally installed Labdoo installation boots on a computer with Secure Boot activated.
Trusted Platform Module (TPM)	TPM is a security chip that secures a computer. Ubuntu-Mate, which forms the basis for Labdoo images, is TPM certified. TPM should only be switched off if Labdoo does not boot.
UEFI	Up to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS It is recommended to disable UEFI and enable Legacy/CSM. However, there is also a concept for a UEFI-based installation developed by Labdoo helpers for 20.04 LTS.
From Ubuntu 22.04 LTS a separate concept was developed for Ubuntu so that both UEFI and legacy/CSM installations are possible. Note: On some computers, Labtix starts and the image installation goes smoothly. But when you restart the laptop you get messages like "Invalid Partition table!" or similar and the laptop doesn't boot up. Then please set the UEFI mode or both (UEFI and Legacy) in the BIOS.
In very stubborn cases, the tool uses SuperGrub2Disk (https://www.supergrubdisk.org) to start Labdoo. The bootloader Grub can be reinstalled using the terminal command “sudo grub-install /dev/sda”. An internet connection is required to download the required files!
Turbo-Boost	If Turbo Boost is activated, the processor may become significantly too hot when operated under load. In Labtix you can tell that under full load (e.g. with the Stress_Cpu tool) the clock frequency is in the 3Ghz range or higher. As a rule, the CPU temperature then rises well above 70 degrees, which can lead to long-term damage to the CPU. That's why it makes sense to switch off the turbo boost as a precaution. If the turbo boost cannot be deactivated or the temperature is still too high, the Cpupower-Gui tool in Labtix can temporarily help. In Labdoo, the maximum CPU frequency must be permanently limited using the script temperature_workaround.sh in the /scripts/temperature_workaround folder on the desktop!
Check the hardware with Labtix

System requirements (currently on https://www.labdoo.org/deu/en/faq#FAQ04)
min. 120 GB disk capacity,
min. 3 GB RAM, better 4 GB,
if the laptop is max. 12 years old, it should fit (usually with Windows 7 / 8 / etc. seal.
Does the donated device meet our minimum requirements (3-4 GB RAM, max. 12 years old, min Windows 7 or higher upon delivery)? https://www.labdoo.org/deu/en/faq#FAQ04
You should look through a donated computer before installing it. It makes no sense to give a laptop that overheats in cool regions to hot countries. Or if the hard drive is already "crumbling", how will it survive transport and operation in hot regions? That's why Labtix comes with useful tools for not only the hard drive, but also speakers, temperature curves under load, and much more. more to check.

Recommended hardware checks
Tool	Check
GSmart / DiskCheck	The “Disk_Check” icon on the desktop opens the GsmartControl tool. Checks the status of the target hard drive, usually “sda”. The more “red” notices or icons and the darker red they are, the sooner the hard drive should be replaced.
StressCpu / psensor	The maximum temperature should be around 55 to 65°C under normal load, depending on the CPU/GPU type and the ambient temperature. To put load on the CPU, the "Stress CPU" script starts on the desktop (triggers "stress --cpu -8" in a terminal). Watch the temperature display of the CPU sensors in psensor. Stress CPU starts after 10 seconds and runs at full CPU load for 60 seconds in order not to damage the CPU and cooling system.
Under full load the temperatures often rise to over 70°C, less would be better. Many manufacturers specify an acceptable maximum temperature (CPU under full load) of 75° degrees. If temperatures rise to 80°C or higher under load, Stress CPU stops immediately to avoid damage to the processor and cooling system. Then the cooling system definitely needs to be revised (e.g. clean the fan or replace the cooler paste/cooling pads). An overheated cooling system can also be recognized by the fact that the copper-colored heat conductor has turned bluish.
Unscrew the cover from the fan area. Shine a lamp into it and check whether you can see the light clearly from outside through the fan. Then air can get through easily :) If not, the fan and ventilation system should be cleaned.
Sometimes it's enough to blow through the ventilation slots from the outside to the inside. The fan should be blocked with a nail or screwdriver so that it does not rotate. Additionally, dust flakes can be removed through the suction hole with a curved needle or soft brush.
If necessary. The thermal paste/film on the CPU cooler must be replaced.
On some devices with Intel i3/5/7 processors, it is helpful to switch off the "Intel Turbo Boost" (it can also be called something else on some devices!) in the BIOS/UEFI in order to get the temperature below 75° degrees during full load.
If the device is running in Turbo Boost mode and this cannot be switched off in the UEFI (recognizable by the fact that the clock frequency of the processor is in the 3 GHz range or higher), the clock frequency can be temporarily reduced using the Cpupower-Gui tool (in the top panel of Labtix). become. Values around 2.5 GHz have proven to be useful. After installing Labdoo, the maximum CPU frequency must be permanently limited in Labdoo using the temperature-workaround script.

installation
preparation
If you already have a bootable CD or USB stick with the Labtix installation environment and Laboo Images for Cloning, you can skip this chapter.

Using the Labtix tool as a live CD/DVD or USB stick (recommended), Labdoo systems prepared by our helpers and equipped with learning content can be easily and quickly transferred ("cloned") to new computers , using so-called Images. As of Labtix 2.09 there are 4 BASIC images in 4 languages (English, Spanish, German, French). Depending on the language in the target country of the IT donation, you can select the language and upload additional learning content in other languages using control files. Local teams maintain additional images, e.g. in Catalan.
You need 2 things:
Labtix on a bootable medium: this can be a DVD (from Labtix 2.xx, from 2022) or a CD (Labtix 1.xx, 2017-2021) or a USB stick (recommended, 2 GB or larger) with which you can boot a computer into the Labtix environment.
External USB hard drive: for storing the Cloning Images and other learning content from our FTP server (Labdoo Hubs in Germany can be obtained from Labdoo.org e.V. Retrieve donated, pre-recorded boot media and USB hard drives.)
Labtix: The Labdoo installation environment
In order to be able to install older and newer computers yourself with a license-free tool, Labdoo.org has put together a small solution based on the Linux version Antix, which we called Labtix (composed of Labdoo and Antix).
In Labtix you will find everything you need - for deleting old data on a donated computer, for quick and automated installation of finished systems. In addition, you will find many tools on Labtix to diagnose hardware and analyze and solve problems (CPU/processor, thermal problems (°C), detect damaged drives, battery status, etc.)

You could download the iso files for Labtix from the folder of our FTP server. You could check the correct download using checksums (MD5 or sha512).
Once you have downloaded the file, you can create a boot medium from the iso file (CD or USB stick). This is the boot medium with which you can start and prepare donated computers.
Create a boot medium (CD or USB stick) from the Labtix ISO
Next, convert the ISO file into a boot CD or USB boot stick (simple copying is not enough!). This can often be done with the file manager of the operating system you trust or with additional tools. Below you will find some suggestions. For more, consult the web (search for "create CD / USB stick iso" and your operating system).

Requirements for Labtix 2:
Installation on DVD possible, a simple CD is no longer sufficient
USB stick with at least 2 GB of storage space. If Labtix is to be expanded using the persistence mode, it may make sense to use a larger stick.
WINDOWS:
Install and start a program for creating start media, e.g. Rufus: https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases/download/v3.4/rufus-3.4p.exe or alternatives https://alternativeto.net/software/rufus/.
Start Rufus, select the USB device, click on the "Select" button, select the labtix.iso file, then click on Start.
LINUX:
In Labtix there is the tool Live USB Maker as well as the tool ISO-Snapshot with the help of which you can create an ISO file from the existing system (recommended).
At https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Brennprogramme/ you will find a range of Linux tools that you can use to burn CDs/DVDs, e.g. Xfburn or Brasero,
zto create bootable USB sticks: Unetbootin, boot media creator, Yumi, drive management etc. As a rule, every distro/desktop environment has a corresponding program installed
With dd, enter the following in the terminal: dd if=/Path/to/Labtix.iso of=/dev/target partition bs=1M
But beware: Persistence cannot be set up on USB sticks created with dd! Further details at : https://antixlinux.com/forum-archive/writing-antix-iso-image-on-usb-flas...
MAC OS:
The balenaEtcher tool at https://www.balena.io/etcher/ creates the boot medium in a simple way after installation: select the image file, specify the target drive and the medium is flashed.

Labdoo Clone Images and additional learning content
You must download the images beforehand for cloning. Images are copies of a complete, pre-installed system. Linux has a great feature that other operating systems do not have. You can transfer a system from computer A to computer B - and it will run!
You can find these images online on our Labdoo FTP server http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/.
You can download individual files via the browser by clicking on them with the right mouse button and then selecting "save link as".
However, this does not work for folders or for many files! These have to be downloaded individually and this is of course not convenient.
Simple methods for downloading multiple files for all common operating systems can be found at https://platform.labdoo.org/content/connecting-labdoo-ftp-server
Images sind groß und der Download dauert lange. Wenn ihr euch mit FTP-Clients auskennt, empfehlen wir daher sie direkt per FTP herunterzuladen (sftp, user labdoo und Passwort labdoo).

Labdoo BASIC Images for Cloning
Images and learning content have been decoupled since summer 2023. Previously, there were turnkey images, e.g. EN_40, EN_80, EN_160, EN_250 etc. Learning content was already pre-installed in these images, but this bloated the images, led to redundancy and long download times.
You can quickly download BASIC images with approx. 16 GB and then complete them with the desired content either during cloning with Labtix 2 or after rebooting. This is much faster, more flexible and saves time and resources.
In order to decide which image and which content is/are best for you, you would have to take the respective framework conditions into account:



Additional learning content
Additional learning content can be combined with the BASIC images. The content must be available locally on a local storage medium or on a local server. Downloading from the FTP server during installation is deliberately not supported (overloading the FTP server and taking a long time).
Either during installation with Labtix. content: none is preset in the mask. If you click on it, you will be redirected to the folder with prepared control files. The names provide information about the content and required disk size, e.g. EN_SW_250 installs English and Swahili content and requires a 250 GB disk.
Or after the installation process with the script installscript-content.sh, which can be found on the desktop in the /scripts folder. The process is the same as before, only you have to manually navigate to the folder with the control files for the content (usually on install-disk/wiki-archives/content_list
).

Preparation of the external USB hard drive (1+ TB)
The downloaded images are already unpacked and ready for immediate use. Copies them to an external hard drive or a local server. The USB disk must be formatted to store large files. For example, FAT32 is not possible because FAT32 can only handle files smaller than 4GB. NTFS is the recommended file system for an external hard drive.

Images and educational content
New functions are available from Labtix 2. In recent years, Labtix has become the most used installation tool worldwide within the Labdoo project.
In keeping with this, Labdoo (Germany) has been providing "pre-assembled, ready-made" images for cloning on the FTP server in various languages and contents for years. And here success has created a bottleneck. Thousands of helpers are now downloading the freely available, free images from the FTP server. The infrastructure and bandwidth, kindly provided free of charge by the Polytechnica Barcelona data center, are being shared by more and more users and this leads to slow downloads.
We have therefore expanded our concept. 2.09 can now handle both "finished" images as before, but also the new BASIC images without content.
These "finished" images will soon be removed from the FTP server. You will then find BASIC images prepared in 4 languages.

The big advantage:
There are now only 4 small BASIC images each approx. 16 GB (DE, EN, ES, FR), which drastically reduces the upload and download volume. So far all images were around 500 GB...
How does it work?
There are now control files that tell Labtix what content to install where. This affects the Kiwix and browser-based archives, which were previously part of the "finished" images.
This means that content is not saved multiple times in images, but only once in the folder http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/wiki-archive/ (you also need the subfolders here locally from the FTP server or ask for them via USB disk from your national hub representative).
This additional feature has other advantages. For example, you can create your own control files and quickly exchange them with each other, e.g. a file for reinstalling special content. Using a control file, it is also possible to install additional learning content in additional languages, e.g. the FR content for the EN_250 package.
The name of the control file specifies: 1. Language at the front refers to the BASIC image, i.e. for EN_250.txt = selects the image EN_BASIC, 250 refers to the recommended disk size of 250 GB. So everything as before. EN_FR_320.txt does the same thing, but also adds the French content, then needs 320 GB. By the way, FR_EN_250 matches the FR_BASIC image and installs EN content to it. In one case the system language when starting up is French, in the other case it is English.
What's the catch?
You need at least Labtix 2.09 (or higher) http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/Labtix/ and the learning content http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/wiki-archive/ .
An installation may take slightly longer. But you save a lot of time when downloading the images. If you have to install a lot of devices, you can save a local image you created yourself. Everything you need is included in Labtix.
Where can we find what?
Control files http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/wiki-archive/control_files/

Connecting to the Labdoo FTP server
The Labdoo FTP server allows users to download files freely. Here are some simple methods on how you can connect to the FTP server. Choose the one that suits you best.
For security reasons, Labdoo does not allow unsecured FTP protocol, only secured SFTP protocol (no ftp, only sftp). And since fall 2023, rsync has no longer been offered for security reasons..
Note: Labdoo is not responsible for third-party software.
1. Accessing the server through your browser
Open the URL http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/ in a browser and navigate via the links (Make sure the URL begins with “http://” and not “ftp://). Here you can download all files for free.
To download a file, click on a link with the right button of your mouse, then click "Save target as" (name can be different depending on your browser and opperating system).
This method's advantage is that you can access without a password, but on the other hand files can only be downloaded individually.
2. Access data to connect to the FTP server
It is more convenient to connect your PC or server directly to the FTP server. Depending on your operating system there are several tools below. We created a user on the FTP server: labdoo with the password labdoo and read permissions (no write permissions), which is available to you for this purpose. If you need write permissions, please contact contact@Labdoo.org (EN) or Labdoo-DACH@Labdoo.org (DE).
Protocol = sftp (sftp is safer than ftp, so only sftp is available)
Server = sftp.labdoo.org
Username = labdoo
Password = labdoo
Path = /sftp://labdoo:labdoo@sftp.labdoo.org
3. Integrate into the file manager (Windows, Swish)
Windows does not offer its own way to connect the file manager to an FTP server via the sftp protocol. ftp would be possible, but we do not offer this for security reasons. However, you can use additional programs sftp, e.g. the Swish Add-on for the Windows file manager http://www.swish-sftp.org/(link is external) .
After installing Swish, you have to set up the access to the FTP-Server:
	Login to the FTP server: Name - choose a name of your choice; server: sftp.labdoo.org; user: labdoo; path: /
	Security key: Save and connect - key remains permanently on the PC until changed; Simply connect - key is only saved for this session and will be queried again next time
	Enter the password labdoo, now you can use the FTP server like a drive on your PC.
4. Filezilla
It is easy to connect your computer to the FTP server with special tools if you need to download massive files. The free FTP client Filezilla can be downloaded here https://filezilla-project.org/.. Also available for Apple (macOS) https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=osx.
The start path can be set in the settings under Advanced --> Default directory on the server. Then you don't always have to click through the whole file system.
	Enter the access data: Server - sftp://sftp.labdoo.org ; Username labdoo ; Password - labdoo ; Port - 22
5. Linux
If you are using GNU/Linux, you can easily integrate the FTP server using the sftp protocol (secure FTP). Simply enter the path for the FTP folder → sftp://labdoo:labdoo@ftp.labdoo.org:/ in your favorite file manager.
6. lftp
lftp is a free FTP client for Linux and other OS.
Install lftp under Linux using sudo apt install lftp.
Then you can mirror the /install-disk folder using the appropriate one-liner with lftp:
lftp -c "open http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/ ;mirror --parallel=10 -n -e -O /path/to/install-disk"
The "-e" option ensures that files that no longer exist on the server are deleted from the local install disk. If this is not desired, simply leave out this option.
The entire command can be entered into the crontab using "sudo nano /etc/crontab" if regular mirroring is desired.
Read more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lftp
7.Connecting Apple (macOS and iOS) using Filezilla or iTransfer to an FTP server
For Apple and (macOS ans iOS) you can install and use the free tools Filezilla or iTransfer.
8.install-disk-maker.sh (Tool recommended by Labdoo)
You can download the tool for conveniently creating an installation disk (install disk) or a folder on a computer, server or NAS for Linux here. A download can be "clicked together" and saved as a download list for later repetitions. The download can only be limited to changed files, which saves download time.
http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/Labtix/install-disk-maker.sh
(if necessary make it executable)
But it is also part of every BASIC image of Labdoo (on the desktop of the user labdoo in the scripts folder). This is how you can do it after installing it on Labdoo laptops
Note for technical helpers: The tool is based on wget. Downloaded files that no longer exist on the FTP server are not automatically deleted by install-disk-maker. Every now and then it's worth clearing up "file corpses".
9. recommended folders or links
If you want you can mirror the whole FTP drive :) Maybe you should choose the content you really need? Here are some useful paths that might be of interest to you:
All data necessary for an installation: http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/
English documents: http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/documents/english/
Graphics + logos: http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/documents/material/
If you have any questions send an e-mail to Labdoo Global Support team wall and a Labdooer will get back to you.

install-disk-maker
Labdoo's install disk is used to distribute Labdoo images and educational content in order to install Labdoo systems. Despite the name Install Disk, images and educational content do not necessarily have to be on a hard drive. Local folders or shares on the local network can also be used. The installation is usually carried out using the installation scripts in the zzFM file manager in Labtix. After installation, additional educational content can be installed from Labdoo using the installscript_content.sh script in the “Scripts” folder on the Labdoo desktop.
In order for the Labdoo installers to work correctly, the following folder structure must be ensured:
For Images:
/install-disk/DE_German_images/22.04_LTS_EN_Basic
/install-disk/EN_Englisch_images/22.04_LTS_DE_Basic etc.
For Kiwix-Dateien:
/install-disk/wiki-archive/kiwix/wikis/DE/Lerninhalt.zim
/install-disk/wiki-archive/kiwix/wikis/EN/Learning_content etc.
For Offline-Wikis:
/install-disk/wiki-archive/wikis/DE/beispiel.tar.gz
/install-disk/wiki-archive/wikis/EN/example.tar.gz etc.
For control files ( content_lists ) :
/install-disk/wiki-archive/content_list/DE_120.txt
/install-disk/wiki-archive/content_list/EN_FR_80.txt etc.

The Content_Lists play a special role (see below). They serve as control files and contain the information about which additional content (wikis and Kiwix files) will be installed during the installation with the installer scripts in Labtix or after the installation with installscript_content.sh in Labdoo. Many Content_Lists already exist on the server. The name contains the minimum size of the hard drives on the devices to be installed. With every download, the contents of the content_lists folder are updated!

It is still possible to use Clonezilla in Labtix to create your own Labdoo images with a lot of content and save them anywhere and clone them using the Labdoo installer in zzFM or with Clonezilla in Labtix.
The Install Disk Maker tool is used to easily create an install disk or a corresponding folder using selection menus. Images and content can be saved specifically in a correct folder structure.
The advantage is that the entire install disk no longer has to be downloaded from the Labdoo servers, thereby significantly reducing download times and server utilization. In addition, individual compilations can be created more easily, e.g. if Labdoo installations with bilingual content are required. Simply download the relevant content to the install disk, create a corresponding Content_List (see below) and you have created the possibility for an individual Labdoo installation.
The install disk maker downloads the desired files from the Labdoo server (http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/). A password is not necessary for this.


The possibilities of the install disk maker:
Reformat an empty hard drive and set it up as an install disk with content,
set up a folder, hard drive or local share as an install disk with content,
update an existing install disk or an existing install disk folder. The tool searches for existing files on the disk or in the folder and updates them if newer versions are available.
update an existing install disk (or install disk folder) using an existing download list or repeat a download using a download list if there is an interruption. A download list is created with each complete run of the tool and stored in the target directory with a time stamp. The download list is a pure text file with a list of the ftp addresses used. It can therefore also be edited manually.
In general, if folders/files already exist in the target folder, only newer versions or versions with a different size will be downloaded. This also helps enormously to reduce download times and relieve the load on the FTP server.


The install-disk-maker
The Install Disk Maker is a shell script with Yad as the frontend for the dialogs. It should run on all Debian-based systems. The dependencies are yad, wget and sed. If not available, these should be installed later if necessary. Simply copy the script to your computer, make it executable, double-click it and run it in the terminal when asked. The script is already integrated into Labtix and Labdoo. It is only available with English user guidance.
Starting the script:
In Labtix: Double-click on the corresponding icon on the desktop (from Labtix 2.10)
In Labdoo: /Desktop/Scripts/install-disk-maker.sh , logged in as user labdoo
After a short README, a selection list appears in which the further procedure is determined.
There are four options to choose from:
1 format and use an unmounted hard disk as target	
2 choose or create and use a folder as target	
3 update an existing install-disk(-folder)	
4 update an install-disk(-folder) with an existing Downloadlist	
Depending on your selection, you will be guided to your destination via self-explanatory dialogues. Only option 1 requires you to enter the sudo password in the terminal once under Labdoo.

Selection of the drive for the install disk. Often sda is your own system disk and sdb is the external drive; like in the screenshot. However, this can change depending on the configuration.	Select disk
Entering the administrator password (sudo)	Enter admin sudo password (only for some options)
Should a download list from a previous download be used. Or should a new list be “clicked together” individually for download.	Select downlist or define new download
Mark the images to download by language	 
Selection of images to load in the language folder	 
Selection of wiki languages for browser-based content	 
Selection of wiki languages for Kiwix	 
Display of the selected content for confirmation	 
Display of the download and progress in the terminal	 
Display of the download and the download list	 
After closing the final “READY” dialog, the existing files and folders in the target folder or disk are displayed in the terminal. This is used to check the contents of the target folder or disk.

Pressing “Enter” in the terminal ends the script and the working folder is cleaned up.
While the script is running, it is possible to mount or unmount disks or shares using a file manager. It is not necessary to end the script.
If an external disk has been formatted, it must be removed from the device once after the script has ended and then reconnected in order to make it available to the system.
While the script is running, some auxiliary files are created in the working folder (or on the desktop in Labtix) which are deleted during the run. Some dialog windows allow you to abort the script and then delete these files. If the script hangs, for example because the connection to the server is interrupted, you can end it by closing the terminal in which the script is running. Some auxiliary files may be retained. To delete these, call the script again and end the "README" dialog with "Cancel". The work folder is cleaned up.
In rare cases, auxiliary files of the stream editor used sed with the name sed* appear in the working folder. These files cannot be edited, but disappear as soon as you close and reopen the file manager or restart the desktop in Labtix.
If you want to repeat the project, we recommend copying the resulting download list to a suitable location so that it is available at any time and/or can be passed on.




2 - Click Installation Method
Sometimes the screen is very dark after booting and the screen cannot be brightened or darkened using the function keys. Then move the mouse to the upper left corner, if necessary "flying blind", click there and then tap on the arrow key to the right. Each time you press the arrow key, the monitor should get a little brighter.
Double-click to start the file manager zzzFM (Labtix 2).
Mount the drive on which the images for cloning are located.
For external USB drives: plug it in, the drive appears with a - in front of it, then click on the entry and the "-" becomes a "+".
Connect to the network, via LAN it is sufficient to plug in the LAN cable, for WLAN with Connman system tray, then open file manager zzzFM → in the input area (preset /home/labdoo/) den Enter the path to the server, e.g. smb://192.168.1.1/install-disk, if necessary enter the password in the terminal window. smb is the protocol required for Windows servers.
First it tries to establish a connection for the user guest, then for the user ladboo. Or you can enter a local user like this: smb://user@192.168.1.1/install-disk and then the password in the terminal window.
The drive / server is now mounted, i.e. the computer has access to it.
Open the folder with the images.
Right click on the folder containing the image to be installed.
Click the displayed functions list on
Labtix 2: labdoo-legacy-installer or labdoo-UEFI-installer (depending on system settings and boot)
in the next window
Labtix 2: Enter the path to the target disk, e.g. sda, nvmep1n or similar → set the number of delete runs,
optional: enter the host ID if you already know it (otherwise it can be changed after the restart)
The image will now being copied to the internal hard disk sda.
At the end GParted opens for control to display the finished partition on sda. The whole hard disk should be available. Close GParted. In rare cases the automatic adjustment of the partition does not work. Then it can be adjusted manually.
The window with the installation's confirmation will appear, confirm with "ok" and close.
The installation will be confirmed in the terminal, then close with ''Enter''.
The installation is complete. Labtix can be shut down with "Poweroff" or "Save Poweroff" and the computer can be restarted.

Troubleshooting
We may need some tools for troubleshooting that make it easier for us to fix errors when installing or starting computers:
Labtix on a USB stick :-) ,
Labtix on USB stick, installed with "dd" with the Live USB Maker,
Labtix on DVD,
a finished standard Labdoo installation on a hard drive to test whether a device can / wants to boot with Labdoo,
a finished legacy Labdoo installation on a hard drive to test whether a device can / wants to boot with Labdoo legacy,
Super Grub 2 Disk (link) as a starting aid for Labtix or Labdoo,
Clonezilla-Live or Parted Magic to install if nothing else works,
Boot Repair Disk ( link ) to fix boot problems with Labdoo.
optional: USB adapter for SATA to be able to "plug in" a hard drive externally,
optional: USB hub for USB / USB-C slots if a laptop doesn't have enough slots
You don't have to create all of these tools directly. It is enough to create them when needed. But the more problem cases you have worked on, the more complete this tool collection becomes.
The easiest way can often be to install a hard drive with a finished Labdoo installation in a "problem" computer. This saves time and nerves!!!

Computer remains "dead":
When plugging in the power supply, the DC indicator light does not light up or the computer beeps:
Power supply defective or not suitable? Make sure you have the correct DC plug.
No RAM memory installed?
Battery deeply discharged? If possible, try starting without a battery or powering the computer for a while. Depending on the device, it can take a few minutes to an hour until the device is bootable!

UEFI not accessible:
Win 10 or 11 is started in installation mode and the UEFI is not accessible: remove the hard drive and delete it externally.
If Windows is already installed and boots to the login screen: Click the power icon, click the "Restart" option with Shift/Shift key >>"Advanced options">> "Troubleshoot" >> "UEFI settings" . In the UEFI then put the Labtix stick first in the boot settings, deactivate secureboot if necessary.
Common keys to get into UEFI: ESC, F1 (Lenovo), F2, F10, F12 (Dell), Del . Depending on the setting in the UEFI, the "Fn" key must be pressed at the same time.
Some devices (some Lenovo or Sony) have their own button to boot into UEFI, sometimes quite hidden. A search on the Internet can be informative.
If Labtix boots into the UEFI boot menu: Boot Rescue Menus >> Reboot into BIOS/UEFI Setup. Labtix may have to be booted via the computer's boot menu.
If you have one, try a Labtix DVD and boot into the UEFI using the Boot Rescue Menu (see above).
Boot into the UEFI boot menu with a Xubuntu USB Live stick. This contains the “UEFI Firmware Settings” option. Is also possible with some other *buntus. You may have to boot via the computer's boot menu.
Sometimes it helps to consistently remove all drives and don't overlook the SD card slot.
On some devices, removing the CMOS battery can force an error message from which access to the UEFI is often possible. Similarly, some devices have a reset button on the bottom that can be reached through a small hole.

Labtix does not boot into the Grub boot menu:
Secureboot switched off in UEFI?
USB boot not possible, e.g. by excluding USB boot in UEFI
Some devices only boot Labtix in UEFI mode, others only in legacy mode, so it makes sense to try it out. The same applies to the installed images.
"USB-always power on" activated in UEFI?
A common problem is the poor connectivity of some USB sticks in USB sockets. If you pull the stick approx. 1mm outwards, the stick may have better contact. If the LED on the stick (if present) lights up or flashes, the contact should be OK.
Use Labtix DVD?
Use Labtix on a stick installed in Labtix with the Live USB Maker with the "dd" option?
The device simply does not want to start with the bootloader used by Labtix or ignores it due to the computer firmware used (e.g. on some Acer laptops). If the device accepts the SuperGrub2Disk bootloader (from USB or CD), Labtix can be started using SuperGrub2Disk. https://www.supergrubdisk.org
If all else fails, you can install a hard drive in the device on which you have installed Labdoo.
If only Win 10 or 11 stubbornly boots, the only solution is to remove the hard drive to start Labtix and/or get into the UEFI. The hard drive should then be erased using an external USB adapter and checked for errors using DiskCheck in Labtix.
(for Labdoo Germany) ...and if all else fails, then send the IT donation to the central post office https://platform.labdoo.org/de/hub?h=119075

Labtix hangs when booting:
If Labtix hangs when booting, it is worth trying out the boot options “failsafe” (driver problems), “nomodeset” (graphics driver problems) or acpi=off (power management problems),
A network search with the computer type, "Linux" and "Boot options" can lead to success in special cases,
If the boot process hangs with the message "waiting for devs to be fully populated ..." you can cancel this process with Ctrl + C,
sometimes a device just won't boot with Labtix. Alternatively, an image can be installed with Parted Magix or Clonezilla Live. The content can then be installed from Labdoo.
There is always the option of installing a hard drive pre-installed with Labdoo.

Installation aborts:
Destination disk damaged? Check with check disk.
Contact to the install disk or the server used is not stable? Or files do not exist on the specified paths?
The Labdoo images use a block size of 4096 bytes. This can cause problems with a few SSDs/NVMEs. Unfortunately, the only solution is to replace the hard drive.
The target hard drive could be too small for the selected image and content.
In general you should carry out an installation with a freshly booted Labtix. If the installation scripts were aborted or hard drives or shares were added or deleted in Labtix, artifacts in the operating system may prevent the installation scripts from running correctly.
Some hard drives have write and/or read protection. The values in Disk-Check then look normal, but no partitions can be deleted or created. The only quick solution here is to replace the hard drive.

MacBooks:
Note: Labdoo Germany accepts MacBooks as IT donations. Labdoo Switzerland does not.
If Labtix does not boot (which is the rule), hold down the Alt key immediately after pressing the power button until a selection of bootable media appears.
The computer's NVRAM may need to be deleted first:
Power button, then hold down "Alt", "P", "Cmd", "R" at the same time for approx. 30 seconds,
In Labtix, pay attention to the clock frequency, if necessary limit it to approx. 2 Ghz with Cpupower-Gui to avoid overheating during the installation of Labdoo. Use the temperature_workaround in Labdoo!
MacBooks with the T2 chip are unfortunately not compatible with Labdoo. The same applies to the new MacBooks with ARM processors.

Labdoo does not boot:
Try booting via the computer's boot menu. Common keys: Esc, F9, F12 on tablets/convertibles Power + Vol"+" or Vol"-". If necessary, together with the Fn key.
Use Gparted in Labtix to check whether the installation on the hard drive looks correct:
Standard installation: grub2core.img, efi partition and Linux partition present and extended to the entire drive?
Legacy installation: Linux partition present and extended to the entire drive?
"Boot flag" and efi flag (standard installation only) set?
Check the hard drive again with Disk Check in Labtix. By deleting hard drives with "shred" when installing Labdoo, they can be damaged if they were already on the brink anyway.
The boot mode may need to be changed in UEFI. Sometimes Labtix only boots in UEFI mode on the same device, but Labdoo boots in Legacy or CMS mode or vice versa
Move Labdoo up in the boot order in the UEFI,
look in the boot menu of the computer to see whether the Labdoo installation appears there and whether it can be started from there,
Start Labdoo using Super Grub 2 Disk (https://www.supergrubdisk.org). Connect to the Internet. Open a terminal with "Ctrl" + "Alt" + "T" and reinstall the bootloader with the command "sudo grub-install". This may cause Labdoo's bootloader to be entered into the computer's firmware.
Start the computer with "Boot Repair Disk" ( link ), establish an internet connection and follow the instructions. Can solve one or two UEFI problems.

Get more messages:
In its default setting, Labdoo does not display the kernel boot messages during booting, but rather the Mate boot logo ("plymouth"). However, if booting or shutting down hangs or takes a long time, you can use the boot messages to diagnose possible sources of error.
To display the boot messages while Plymouth is displayed: press "ESC" + "F1"
If you want to show all messages:
After switching on, use the shift key to make Grub's boot menu visible. If necessary, try several times, the default time window is 3 seconds!
If you are in the boot menu and the first entry is activated, press the "E" key to enter editor mode.
Find the line with linux /boot/vmlinuz.... and replace quiet splash with noplymouth. The American keyboard layout applies!
Boot with F10.
The most recent boot messages can be used to search for errors on the Internet. When searching, always specify the device used.
The changed settings only apply once, so they have to be changed every time you boot.
When the computer boots into Labdoo, the "dmesg" command in the terminal displays the boot messages. Problems are usually displayed in red.

Secure boot activated and cannot be deactivated
Important note: Labtix does not boot with Secureboot!!! However, the Grub boot menu appears and the message “secureboot” appears at the bottom left. However, it is often possible to access the UEFI in order to deactivate Secureboot via the Boot Rescue Menus >> Reboot into BIOS/UEFI Setup entries.
On some computers, Secureboot can only be deactivated if an administrator password has previously been set in the UEFI.
There is a small trap with some Acer computers: if you deactivate Secureboot and set the boot mode to "UEFI", Secureboot is automatically activated again!
If the computer's UEFI is protected with an unknown password and Secureboot is activated, it is still worth trying to install. As a rule, all *buntus like Ubuntu Mate, the basis of the Labdoo images, can be installed easily with Secureboot.
Since Labdoo images are installed through cloning, the installation step in which the Ubuntu secureboot certificate is entered into the computer's firmware is no longer necessary. This means that, depending on the computer firmware or the secure boot settings, the computer is prevented from booting Labdoo. Nevertheless, it is worth a try to have the certificates subsequently entered into the firmware. Unfortunately, this doesn't always work.

Installation of Labdoo:
The quickest way to work is to install a hard drive pre-installed with Labdoo.
Does the computer still have to be installed, e.g. because of a soldered hard drive
Installation with Clonezilla in Parted Magic, then install contents in Labdoo.
If the Labdoo installation does not boot: see "Labdoo does not boot".
Once Labdoo has been made to boot (unfortunately this is not always possible), an update must be carried out:
Connect to the Internet and open a terminal with "Ctrl" + "Alt" + "T" and enter the following commands one after the other:
sudo apt update >>> check for updates,
sudo apt upgrade >>> run the updates.
If asked, answer yes and provide the Labdoo admin password.
During the update you should be asked whether you want to create a secureboot password. This must be answered in the affirmative and entered accordingly. Write on a piece of paper and keep it safe :-)) . It may be that if there are changes to the hardware (e.g. new WiFi card) the password will be requested!
Restart Labtix once, then enter sudo apt autoremove >>> in the terminal to remove unnecessary files.
For very inflexible devices:
Unfortunately, this type of installation is not trivial, which is why the procedure can only be outlined superficially. If you really want to give it a go, you'll have to search online from time to time to get further:
Install a hard drive pre-installed with Labdoo in the device,
Install Xubuntu on the device in parallel. During the installation, the kernel or its secure boot certificate is entered into the UEFI partition and the firmware of the computer.
In the corresponding window, select the option "Install Xubuntu alongside Ubuntu",
during Xubuntu installation, set the partition size for Xubuntu to approximately 12 Gb,
After installation, set the default boot entry of the Grub bootloader to the partition with Labdoo. Unfortunately it's not entirely trivial; it's best to use the Internet to find out,
After booting into Labdoo for the first time, update the system once as described above.
...and if nothing works, send the IT donation to the central post office... ;) (Labdoo Germany only)

Labtix boot setting and persistence
Labtix has two boot menus. Once the menu for legacy boot and the menu for UEFI boot. Whether you boot into the legacy or UEFI boot menu depends on the settings in the UEFI. On many devices, both options can be selected via the computer's boot menu.
Legacy boot menu from Labtix:
Set the desired options using the corresponding function keys (e.g. F2 for language or F4 for kernel boot options) and, if desired, set them up permanently with F8. A reset is possible at any time with F8 > Reset. Alternatively, you can also enter it directly in the “Boot Options” line. After the next reboot, the boot menu contains the menu entry "Custom..."
Labtix UEFI boot menu:
The UEFI boot menu contains the “Advanced Options” entry through which options can be set up and saved using submenus.

Persistence mode
In persistence mode, all your changes are saved, such as . Network connections, Firefox bookmarks, changes within the Labtix environment, etc. . Installing programs and saving files is also possible.
To do this, press F5 in the Labtix grub menu in legacy mode and select "persist_all",
then press F8 and select "save",
then you boot e.g. "antix-21 x64-base ...",
When asked for the rootfs persistence file, press "Enter" for the default size,
When asked for the homefs persistence file, press "Enter" for the default size,
If you are asked for the live USB swap file, select "n" for "no",
The question "Do you want to copy the files to the home persistence device?" answered with "y" for "yes",
The question "Please choose auto-save mode" answered with "2" for semi-automatic,
If you wanted to use changes via persistence, you should not boot toram and remove the stick, because then Labtix cannot save your changes when you shut down.
Using the ISO Snapshot and Live USB Maker tools in Labtix, a new bootable stick can be created that includes all changes. The Unetbootin we previously recommended for creating live USB sticks uses the fat32 file system, which limits the maximum persistence size to 4 GB. The Live USB Maker uses ext4 as the file system and therefore allows for greater persistence. If the Live USB stick was created with the dd program or the "dd" option of the Live USB Maker, it is not possible to permanently set up boot options and set up persistence. The corresponding options do not appear in the boot menus.l

Terminal commands
Even if, contrary to popular opinion, the use of a terminal in Linux is not absolutely necessary, it does offer some advantages. Terminal commands give you output faster than pushing the mouse. Terminal commands can be controlled and linked in a variety of ways using arguments and are therefore the method of choice for more complex problem solving.
To open a terminal, click on the icon at the bottom left of the bottom menu bar or press Ctrl + Alt + t on the keyboard.
If a command is refused with the note "permission denied" or root rights are required, type "sudo" before the command used, e.g. "sudo zzzfm"
For further information use the --help option e.g. "apt --help" or the man pages "man apt"

Unlock a hard-blocked device:
Looking for a hardware switch for Wifi,
looks for a function key for Wifi, usually together with the Fn key on the keyboard,
checks whether the device is blocked in the UEFI/BIOS.
(sudo) shred	Tool to securely wipe devices or partitions
Use:
sudo shred /dev/sdX -v -f -n 2 >> overwrites sdX 2 times
Shred overwrites every single byte of the target device, which can take a very long time.
Make sure that the correct target hard drive is specified when entering the command!
sudo	Command to get root permissions
There is no sudo password set up in Labtix, so entering a password is not required.
wipefs	Quick deletion of file systems
Use:
sudo wipefs -a -f /dev/sdX >> wipes the file system of sdX
Make sure that the correct target hard drive is specified when entering the command!
This is not a safe method for wiping devices, but rather a quick and non-complete solution if you want to reset an installed system. Uses the shred command to securely delete
xkill	Tool to close windows that don't respond
Use:
Open a terminal, type “xkill” and press “Enter”. The mouse cursor is displayed as a skull. Left-click the skull in the window you want to close. Xkill only closes windows. In some cases, processes started by the terminated window continue to run in the background.
Don't click on the desktop, if there is also a window!!!
xrandr	Tool for setting the graphical (X) server
xrandr --output eDP-1 --scale 0.5x0.5 >> reduces the height and width resolution of the output eDP-1 by a factor of 0.5. Very useful if the screen has a very high resolution.
This is how you get the name of the actual output:
xrandr | grep primary



Review of a donated laptop
Check the hardware with Labtix
To start, you should check a donated computer. After all, it makes no sense to send a laptop to hot countries that already overheats in cool regions. Or if the hard drive is already "crumbling", how is it supposed to survive transport and operation in hot regions? That's why Labtix comes with useful tools to check not only the hard drive, but also speakers, temperature sensors under load and much more. more to check, if necessary to clean fan, to renew thermal paste or foil.
BIOS settings
Some laptops require changing BIOS settings:
BIOS settings	Comment
Secure Boot	Must always be off (disabled). Sometimes an administrator password must first be set in order to disable Secure Boot. The admin password can then be removed again.
Trusted Platform Module (TPM)	TPM is a security chip that secures a computer. In connection with Linux, however, TMP should always be switched off (deactivated). With some laptops, an administrator password must first be set in order to be able to deactivate the TPM. The admin password can then be removed again.
UEFI	Up to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS It is recommended to turn off UEFI and enable Legacy/CSM. However, there is also a concept for an UEFI-based installation for 20.04 LTS developed by Labdoo helpers.
From Ubuntu 22.04 LTS a separate concept was developed for Ubuntu so that both UEFI and Legacy/CSM installations are possible. Note: Labtix starts on some computers and the installation of the image runs smoothly. But when you restart the laptop, you get notices like "Invalid Partition table!" or similar and the laptop won't boot. Then please set the UEFI mode or both (UEFI and Legacy) in the BIOS.
In very stubborn cases, the tool uses SuperGrub2Disk https://www.supergrubdisk.org.
Recommended hardware checks
Tool	Check
GSmart	Please check the status of the target disk (sda) with the tool GSmartControl. The more "red" notes or icons and the darker they are, the sooner the hard drive should be replaced.
StressCpu / psensor	The maximum temperature should be around 55 to 65°C under normal load, depending on the CPU / GPU type and the ambient temperature. To load the CPU, the "Stress CPU" script starts on the desktop (triggers "stress --cpu -8" in a terminal). Observe the temperature display of the CPU sensors in psensor. Stress CPU starts after 10 seconds and runs at full CPU load for 60 seconds so as not to damage the CPU and cooling system.
The temperatures often rise to over 70°C under full load, less would be better. Many manufacturers indicate an acceptable maximum temperature (CPU under full load) of 75 degrees. If the temperatures rise to 80°C or higher under load, Stress CPU immediately stops to avoid damage to the processor and cooling system. Then the cooling system needs to be revised (e.g. cleaning the fan or replacing the cooler paste/cooling pads). An overheated cooling system can also be recognized by the fact that the copper-colored heat conductor has turned bluish.
Unscrew the cover from the fan area. Shine using a lamp inside and check whether you can see the light well from the outside through the fan. Then the air can also get through :) If not, the fan and ventilation system should be cleaned.
Sometimes it's enough to blow through the ventilation slits from outside in. The fan should be blocked with a nail or screwdriver to prevent it from rotating. In addition, dust flakes can be removed with a curved needle or soft brush through the suction hole..
If necessary, the thermal paste/foil on the CPU cooler must be renewed.
For some devices with Intel i3/5/7 processors, it is helpful to switch off the "Intel Turbo Boost" (may have a different name for some devices!) in the BIOS/UEFI in order to get the temperature below 75°C under full load.
Speaker Test	Alternately checks the left and right speakers.

Click Partition
partition4
Click Continue. The process may take a while.
We are now ready to install Ubuntu on the new partition. But there is one task left: to install a boot manager.

Install rEFInd Boot Manager
Disable SIP (System Integrity Protection)
SIP protects critical areas on the disk from being altered, and rEFInd needs to write to one of those areas. Thus, we need to disable SIP before installing rEFInd

Check to see if SIP is enabled or disabled. Open a Terminal and type “csrutil status”
csrutil
If it says “enabled” like in the capture above, follow the steps below to disable it

Reboot and hold the Command + R key until you see the Apple logo. It will boot into Recovery mode.
Select “Utilities” -> “Terminal”
At the terminal, type csrutil disable
Reboot and log back in as labdoo
Installing rEFInd

Open a Terminal
Open the folder where you downloaded the files earlier
Arrange the Terminal window and the folder window so you can see both at the same time:
refind install
Drag and drop the “refind-install” file into the Terminal folder
In the Terminal window, hit Enter or Return key to execute the command. Enter the password when prompted
refind install command
We are now ready to install Ubuntu.

03: Install Ubuntu Mate
Tags:

ubuntu install
When the installation completes, click restart to reboot the system. Hold the Option key while the system reboots until you see the original boot menu
IMPORTANT NOTE:
The installation of Ubuntu overwrites the EFI boot area that we created earlier in the “Installing rEFInd” section. But without the EFI boot area, the Ubuntu installation would fail for some reason that I haven’t figured out. Thus, we’ll have to install rEFInd again.

Select booting from macOS partition and hit Enter key
Repeat the steps in the Installing rEFInd section again

How to (Physically) Clean a Laptop to Make it Look New Again
Tags: 
clean laptop
The donated used laptops often come dirty in appearance. After making sure the laptop is not broken, the next step to take is to clean the laptop case. Here's how to properly clean a laptop.

What you need: some soft clothes, a small bottle of 91% isopropyl alcohol, a box of cotton swabs.

LCD Screen
LCD screens are pretty delicate, and you don't want to press hard on them, because that can burn out the pixels. Instead, grab a dry soft cloth and gently wipe the screen. If you need to, add a little bit of alcohol. In most cases, that should be all you need. Do not use anything paper-based, like paper towel, Kleenex, or toilet paper, since it can scratch up your screen.

Keyboard
Clean dirty keys with a swab of rubbing alcohol to remove oil, grime, and germs. Don't forget to turn the laptop's power off before you start cleaning.

A warning note
Isopropyl alcohol vapor is more dense than air and is highly flammable with a very wide combustible range. It should be kept away from heat and open flame.

Packaging the Laptops Ready for Traveling
Packaging the laptops ready for traveling

Once a laptop has been sanitized, we need to package it so it can travel to a destination school. The main goals of the packaging are two-fold: (1) the packaging should protect the laptop from any possible rough traveling conditions; (2) the packaging should make visible the Labdoo identifier of the laptop, for both its AC adapter and the laptop itself. A recommended approach is to use transparent, bubble plastic wrap and to tape the Labdoo identifier in big letters outside, for both the laptop and its AC adapter, as shown in the following pictures:

Figure. A good way to pack your dootronics: use a wrapping material to properly protect them and write the Labdoo IDs clearly outside both the devices and the AC adapters.

You are welcome to use other packaging approaches based on what's available to you, as long as the laptop is well protected and its Labdoo identifier is made visible externally.

Tips and Tricks, Suggested Solutions
The following section describes relevant learning experiences gained by Labdooers around the world who (like you) are helping to sanitize laptops and make them ready for needy schools. It will teach you tips and tricks that will be very handy when sanitizing your laptops. If you are not able to find a solution to your problem in this section, please ask your questions to the Labdoo QA team and another Labdooer there will provide an answer for you.

Configuring the Bios
How to change the booting order of a laptop from the bios

BIOS (Basic Input Output Subsystem) is a programmable chip that controls how information is passed to various devices in the computer system. A typical method to access the BIOS settings screen is to press ESC, F1, F2, F8 or F10 right after you start your computer.

BIOS settings allow you to run a boot sequence from a hard drive, a CD-ROM drive, the network, or an external device. You may configure the order that your computer searches these physical devices for the boot sequence.

The first device in the order list has the first boot priority. To install the Labdoo software you will need to ensure the CD-ROM, the USB or the network (depending on which method you use to install the software) are given the highest booting priority.

Note: in the case of a USB installation, before you set boot priority for the USB device, plug the device into a USB port to ensure the BIOS will be able to detect it.

To specify the boot sequence:

Start the computer and press ESC, F1, F2, F8 or F10 (depending on the BIOS manufacturer, try them all if needed) multiple times during the initial startup screen. A menu may appear.
Choose to enter BIOS setup. The BIOS setup utility page appears.
Use the arrow keys to select the BOOT tab. System devices appear in order of priority.
To give the CD/DVD, the USB or the Network the highest boot sequence priority, move such device to the first position in the list.
Save and exit the BIOS setup utility.
The computer will restart and will initiate its booting process by looking first at the device you gave the highest priority, allowing you to install the Labdoo software.
Figure. Illustration of the BIOS boot menu where you can change the booting order.

Troubleshooting potential issues with the bios.

In some rare cases the BIOS could be reset during the process of deleting the hard drive information from the system, or some times older laptops do not support internal and/or external USB keyboards during the booting process. It might happen that you are not able to use the arrow keys (up, down, right, left) to configure the BIOS. In such cases the USB control (and sometimes the internal keyboard) was deactivated. A possible solution is to connect an external PS/2 or USB keyboard, and continue to install or adjust the BIOS.

Installation of Restricted Codecs
Tags: 
codecs
illegal
legal
restricted
Please notice that the usage of restricted codecs might depend on local laws. It might be illegal in some countries to install and use certain codecs (commercial/proprietary third-party packages) and multimedia extensions. Check your local regulations first prior to proceeding with the installation of the following software.

As in all software for Ubuntu, there are two ways to do the installation: via the Ubuntu Sofware Center or via the command line.

The installation via the Ubuntu Software Center is as follows. Open the Ubuntu Software Center (or the Synaptic Package Manager) and search for "restricted codecs". Select the package found and click on install. During the installation you will need to accept an EULA license agreement. To have full support to watch DVDs you must also install libdvdcss2 and non-free-codecs from the Medibuntu Repository. Please notice that in Europe these repositories are not allowed to be used. Further information can be read here: http://www.videolan.org/developers/libdvdcss.html

The same installation can be done via the command line through the following steps. Open a terminal by pressing at the same time the keys ALT+CTRL+T. Then type the following commands:

sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras -y (Enter)
sudo apt-get install non-free-codecs -y (Enter)
sudo apt-get install curl -y (Enter)
curl ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/debian/videolan-apt.asc | (Enter)
sudo apt-key add -echo "deb ftp://ftp.videolan.org/pub/debian/stable ./" | (Enter)
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libdvdcss.list (Enter)
sudo apt-get update (Enter)

Starting from April 2018 and with the 18.04 LTS (L)Ubuntu release, a Samba server comes pre-installed on image cloned laptops. This means that a Labdoo laptop can be used as a server to other computer clients allowing these clients to access all the educational content in the server. This is a powerful configuration as it allows many types of devices (laptops, tablets, mobile phones, etc.) to access the educational content in the server without the need to have access to the Internet or the need to replicate the educational software in many devices.

Due to the speed of the server or the network, there are limitations in the number of computer clients that can be supported by one computer server. If too many clients are connected, the performance of the data transfer will become slow. So if you have many computer clients, it may be necessary to have more than one computer server.

This page describes how you can convert a Labdoo laptop into your own computer server to provide access to other computer clients. With a few simple steps a server can be set-up, check out the next instructions on how to do that!

Install Samba server

Install the package "samba" by running in a terminal sudo apt-get install samba or via the Linux package manager, e.g. synaptic.
Type smbd [Enter] in a terminal to start the Samba server manually. To avoid starting this program each time manually, you can add "smbd" as a command in menu → Preferences / Settings → Personal / Personal → StartUp Applicatons / Start Programs → with "Add" → Name: Samba / command: smbd / Comment: add start up of Samba Server.. This will start the Samba server every time you reboot the system.
If necessary, install additional extensions to the system's file managers to bring a better use experience. For instance you can install "caja-share" by typing in a terminal sudo apt-get install caja-share or by using the synaptic package manager (this extension is also part of the Labdoo Image since April 2018).
Set up the Shared Folders

Open Caja as administrator/root by running sudo caja [Enter] in a terminal and right click on the folder you want to share. Click in the context menu "Share". Please notice that if Caja is not started as root, the menu item "Sharing" will not appear.
Activate "Share this folder" and "Guest access", then enter your own "Share name".
Close Caja.
Alternatively for LXDE Desktop, install instead the File Manager PCManFM: Go → network → usually then the server is already recognized and displayed, otherwise Windows network → Workgroup → Server name select, usually labdoo-00000xxxx where xxxx is the Labdoo ID of the computer.
Finally, don't forget that the computer must be connected to the network via LAN cable or WiFi.
Access to the server via tablet, mobile phone, laptop or PC clients

Depending on your client and operating system installed and in use (Android, iOS, Windows, Linux etc.) access to the server may be different. Below you will find some examples and tips. There are also useful programs such as file managers, browsers, pdf viewers or ebook readers on your device. Check if your file manager is able to connect to a server (not all apps are able to) or if additional extensions need to be installed.

Access to the Server Using a Client

In a (L)Ubuntu officially cloned Labdoo laptop comes with the file manager Caja. Either use the Menu → Places or use Caja and in the left column go to "Browse the Network" to scan and show all the servers in the network.
Android - open your file manager and click on "network". The network will be scanned for SMB-shares which will be shown in a file manager. If your installed file manager is not able to handle SMB, you have to install one with this ability. We recommend the file managers Ghost-Commander (to be installed using the apps store Google Play: both Ghost Commander and Ghost Commander - Samba Plugin need to be installed) or the X-plore add on.
iOS (Work in Progress)
Windows (Work in Progress)
To open the "Public" shared folder just double-click it. Then confirm "Connect as anonymous" to get connected.
For a faster experience, nearly all operating systems and file managers offer a way to bookmark favorite folders. Use it to bookmark the access to the server.
Connecting to the Server Using Ghost Commander in Android

The example Ghost Commander is similar to other file managers.

Start Ghost Commander.
Open "home" directory (arrow with dot right upper corner).
Click on "Windows shares".
In the window "Connect to Windows PC" click on "Search". No further input should be needed to connect to the server.
Click on "Workgroup".
Click on the name of the server you want to connect to.
The shares of the server should be listed in your file manager.
To create a Bookmark Using Ghost Commander

Click and hold on for about 2 seconds on the share you want to bookmark until a context menu opens.
Click on the context menu "NAME_OF_THE_FOLDER as favorite".
Now you will see the share at /Home (Arrow and dot upper right corner) /Favorites and have direct access, provided the SMB server is online and connected to the local network.
Note: Some file managers first store documents and pages locally before opening and displaying them. This can end up filling up the memory in your device. Cleaning up the memory can help.

Display Educational Content and Documents

Off-line web content: can be shown in your client's browser. Local off-line content must be stored using relative links (not absolute links).
pdf: to be displayed and read using a PDF viewer.
Office documents: It does not matter if you want to open and read Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, OpenOffice documents etc. in all these cases a viewer software app must be installed which can handle the file content.
Video / audio files: In this case the client must also have matching software / apps installed to watch videos or to listen to audio files.
Make Xowa Accessible from other Devices

Xowa comes with an http-server to help share Xowa wikis within a local network. Navigate to the folder /home/labdoo/Public/xowa and open a terminal (e.g. using the file manager Caja: File →open a terminal here). Run the Xowa-jar file in this folder as follows:

For 64 Bit installations: java -jar xowa_linux_64.jar --app_mode http_server [Enter]
For 32 Bit installations: java -jar xowa_linux.jar --app_mode http_server [Enter]

Don't close this terminal window, as otherwise the Xowa process will be stopped. So leave it open as long as Xowa is used by other client devices.

Some devices, operating systems and browsers can resolve the hostname into its IP address. The IP address is like the address number of a home, which controls the access to each device inside your LAN (Local Area Network).

If the IP address cannot be resolved automatically you can get it manually. From the server computer, first right mouse click on the network/WiFi symbol on the desktop → Connection Information → read IP address (often similar to 192.168.1.xxx). Notice: The IP address will change every time, when you reboot the server (if you run DHCP for dynamic IPs in your network). It might be helpful to assign a static IP address to your server.

Read Xowa Content on any Client

The following is based on the IP address 192.168.1.133 just to illustrate an example. Instead of this IP address, use your server's IP address. Open the browser of your choice on your device (tablet, mobile phone, PC) and type the address of the server:
SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:8080
In our example: 192.168.1.133:8080:8080

Using a Laptop as WiFi Hotspot to provide educational data to mobile devices
Tags:

web server
Introduction
If a Labdoo laptop is member of a LAN or WiFi network, it can provide data (educational content) to other devices of that network, e.g. to mobile phones or tablets. This can be done either by some network share – e.g. via samba (smb) or e.g. via a web server (e.g. Apache web server). In both cases, educational content on that laptop could be accessed by other mobile devices (mobile phones, tablets) via their web browser. This might be a reasonable use case if these mobile devices do not contain Labdoo educational content (e.g. due to having not enough disc space for this content)or no having internet connection.
In the case of a WiFi connection, we commonly assume that our laptop is connected to a WiFi router, to which all other mobile devices are connected.
laptop and wifi router

But what do we do if no WiFi router is available? If a WiFi USB-adapter or a built-in Wifi is available on it, is possible to use a laptop as hotspot and host a WiFi network. There a 2 options - use a Samba (smb) file server, which offers a Windows-compatible server (easy to start and handle). Or you can use Apache server, which is bringing a full web server to a laptop (more complex), being able to spread content and web-sites locally and world-wide (if connected to internet).
Such a setup is outline in this document.

Target Group
The target groups are Labdoo schools, which do not have a running WiFi network, but need a network to provide file, content and/or Internet access to other mobile devices.
Example: The Labdoo school have tablets or smartphones, but no Labdoo content on them.

Then the school is able to use a Labdoo laptop as server and spread the educational content to mobile devices. The number of mobile devices to be provided by one laptop depends on its capacity, mainly speed of CPU, disc and WiFi connector. In our tests we found 3 - 10 devices a reasonable number of clients to be connected to one laptop.

Each Labdoo laptop comes with a preinstalled Samba server (smb). How to start the smb-server and how to connect mobile devices to it is explained here.

You will find most content on each laptop in the folder /home/labdoo/Public/wikis. Navigate in a browser of your mobile device to the sub-folder (language) needed. Search for the start file, in most cases index.html, start-here.html or similar. Then you can read and use links etc. on your mobile device as reading on a laptop. Please note that Xowa content does not work using a web browser.

Technical Aspects
Most modern smartphones can be used to host a WiFi network. However, not all WiFi chips of laptops or USB-sticks (and their drivers) support this feature. According to the Ubuntu Users Wiki [1], these WiFi chips do the job:
• chips driven by the hostap driver or
• chips working with a current mac80211/nl80211 sub-system
A detailed description on how to set up the laptop as a WiFi hotspot is given in the Ubuntu Users Wiki [1]. The procedure works with (L)Ubuntu 14.04 - 18.04 LTS.
• provide files access (e.g. via Samba, offering Windows-compatible file services) and / or
• run a webserver to provide browser based access on educational content (e.g. via Apache)
• share its Internet connection (e.g. if the Laptop has WWAN)
to mobile devices connected to the WiFi.

User concept, add user student
Tags: 
user
When installing Lubuntu-Installation the first user created is labdoo (who is also administrator and should be reserved for the teachers, as this user may destroy the system by mistake). If you install via cloning or if you use the installation scripts the additional user student will be created automatically.

The user student kas less rights, e.g. is not able to install or delete software and is not able to destroy the system.

Here is the manuel way, how to create a user student:

Start here → System Tools → User + Groups → unlock → +add user → system password (labdoo) → student as name, e.g. withpassword labdoo → Account Type = Standard (as suggested) → Create → click on password (account disabled) → input of password labdoo and acknowledge → Change → optional: cahnge language of user student.

Open a terminal and type (by executing this zhe user student will become member of the group labdoo):
sudo usermod -aG labdoo student (Enter)

Please note:
Each new user takes disc space. So please do not create more users.

As a standard user you are not able to destroy a system by mistake (or at least it is very hard). The user labdoo (administrator) should only be used by teachers.

Each user has his own folder and files in the directory /home/....(name of the user). But the folder home/labdoo/Public is a public folder. All users should have access here. To go there open the file explorer → filesystem → home → labdoo → folder /Public (you can add a bookmark to navigate here more easily).

If you add content of your own in /Public there is a script http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/install-disk/installskripts/set-rights-fo... to ensure all rights are set correctly.

In addition there is the user guest. guest needs no password to log-in. But guest is not able to change or store anything. When logging out all his input will be deleted automatically.

Sanitizing Smartphones
Tags: 
smartphone
sanitize
Smartphones can also take a crucial role in enabling a path to education for children around the world. In many situations, a smartphone can be the lifeline that connects children with their school teacher, specially in rural areas. Without this lifeline, children often loose all chances to continue their school programs. Smartphones can be as computationally powerful (and can even be as expensive) as computers. Further, many smartphones tend to have large screens, which makes them suitable for education.

The Labdoo Smartphone Program focuses on enabling the circular economy of smartphones in order to help disadvantaged students from around the world gain access to educational content.

Minimum phone requirements:

As a Labdoo hub, when accepting smartphone donations, please make sure the phone satisfies the following minimum requirements:

The phone must be in good shape. Make sure the screen is not broken and that the phone boots and runs correctly.
The phone must be based on the Android software version 5 or above.
Sanitation Process:

When you receive an unused smartphone, please follow the next instructions to sanitize it and ensure all personal data is fully removed:

Step 1. Tag it.

Follow the usual instructions to tag a device: https://platform.labdoo.org/content/tagging-and-updating-state-dootronic.

As usual, tagging is a very important step to ensure the transparency and traceability of the devices globally. Please make sure the device is properly tagged through the Labdoo platform. This will also allow participants to receive automatic notifications of the state of the device as it makes its way to the destination school.

Step 2. Encrypt it.

Modern Android devices are always encrypted out-of-the-box. However, in the case of older Android models, the device may or may not be encrypted. If you are using an Android device running a version below 7.0, please follow the next steps to ensure the phone is encrypted.

For Android handsets and tablets running Android 5.0 Lollipop or newer, you can navigate straight to the “Security” menu under settings. Getting here might be slightly different depending on your phone, but with stock Android, this can be found under Settings > Personal > Security. Here you should see an option to “Encrypt phone” or “Encrypt tablet”.



You’ll be asked to plug your phone in to charge while the process takes place, just to make sure that your phone doesn’t shut off and cause errors. If you haven’t done so already, you will be prompted to set a lock screen PIN or password, which you will need to enter when you turn your phone on or unlock it in order to access your newly encrypted files. Be sure to remember this password!



Step 3. Factory reset it.

To factory reset your phone, go to your phone's settings and look for a section called "Backup and reset." If you don't see that, open the System section of the settings and then look for "Backup and reset," "Reset," or "Reset options" — or, on Samsung devices, open the General Management section and then look for the "Reset" option there. In some cases, you might have to tap a line labeled "Advanced" before any reset-related options will show up.

Find and select the command to perform a full factory data reset and select any subsequent options to erase all types of data and accounts. The system will likely give you a confirmation screen or two and then ask you to input your PIN, pattern, or password for protection. Complete all those tasks, then sit back and wait while Android does its work.



That's it! At this point the phone should have no sensitive information and it should be in the same state as when the phone was first bought out of the factory.

Note for the hubs:

When soliciting mobile phones to your local community, please make sure to ask donors that they perform a factory reset before accepting the phone. This will ensure that data has been erased and also that there is no password associated with the phone. You can forward the instructions in "Step 3. Factory reset it" to the donors prior to accepting the phones.

This wiki book includes a list of email templates that labdooers can use to help automate the process of replying to email requests. For instance, when a hub manager receives an edoovillage creation request from a destination school, the manager can automatically use the 'Response to Dootronics Solicitation' template. While each request will have its own specific requirements, using general templates to help automate responses to email requests help in two ways:

They help standardize and unify the messages that all labdoeers provide to solicitors, making the process more globally consistent/coherent.
They avoid labdooers having to re-write over and over emails that are identical or very similar.

2. 'Cannot serve' response.

In some occasions, solicitors ask us to donate laptops to individuals or non-education projects, which is not part of Labdoo's mission. For such cases, you can use the following response.

Dear $SOLICITORNAME,

Thank you for contacting Project Labdoo.

Project Labdoo's mission is to bring laptops loaded with education software to well organized education centers. As such, we regretfully cannot donate laptops to individuals or to organizations outside the Project's mission scope and so, unfortunately, we cannot serve your request.

Alternatively, if you are enrolled in a school program, we could explore the possibility of bringing laptops to your school. If this is an option, you would be able to use the contributed laptops by borrowing them from the school in a time-shared basis together with the rest of your classmates. Notice that there is an involved process to create a project to receive laptops in a school, so this may not accommodate your immediate needs. Let us know if otherwise.

Thank you for reaching out.

3. Resposta quan no és possible portar ordinadors.

E algunes ocasions, els solicitants demanen dootronics (ordinadors portàtils, ...) per a persones o projectes que no tenen com a objectiu l'educació i, per tant, per a objectius que no són part de la missió de Laboo.org. Per aquests casos, pots utilitzar la següent resposta.

Hola $NOMDELSOL·LICITANT,

Gràcies per contactar amb el projecte Labdoo.org.

La missió del projecte Labdoo és portar dootronics (portàtils, tablets, ...) carregats amb programari educatiu a centres educatius ben organitzats. Així doncs, no podem donar dootronics a persones o organitzacions que tinguin altres objectius diferents a l'educació i, per tant, desafortunadament, no podem gestionar la teva sol·licitud.

De totes formes, si estàs vinculat a una escola, es podria mirar de portar dootronics a aquella escola. D'aquesta forma, podries utilitzar els dootronics donats a l'escola i compartir-los amb la resta d'alumnes d'aquesta. Pensa, però, que això requereix temps i, pert tant, és possible que no resolgui les teves necessitats immediates.

Lieber Antragsteller, liebe(r) $SOLICITORNAME,

Vielen Dank für Ihre Kontaktaufnahme und Anfrage. Um Ihren Bedarf besser zu verstehen und prüfen zu können, benötigen wir Ihre Angaben z.B. zum Projekt und ob es potentielle Flugpaten zum Transport der IT-Spenden gibt.

Weitere Informationen und den Antrag (request) für IT-Spenden für Ihr „Edoovillage“ (so heißen bei Labdoo.org Schulen, Heime, Jugendprojekte usw.) finden Sie im Wiki.

Antrag https://www.labdoo.org/de/content/start-laptop-request
(Den Antrag öffnen, im Browser → speichern unter → dann mit Editor oder Word öffnen, ausfüllen und einsenden, danke)

Bitte füllen Sie es soweit als möglich aus. Was Sie nicht wissen, lassen Sie frei. Bitte senden Sie es mit einigen Fotos vom Projekt zurück (für das Ausland bitte auch vom Umland, dem Ort, der Schule und den Kindern). Danach stellen wir es im Fall der Annahme auf unsere Homepage.

Im FAQ Forum http://www.labdoo.org/de/content/faq-forum finden Sie die häufigsten Fragen, auch zum Zoll usw. beantwortet.

Alle bisherigen Projekte stehen auf https://www.labdoo.org/de/content/edoovillages-dashboard. Sie können dort auch nach Ländern u.a. Kriterien filtern.

Wichtig ist auch, dass Antragsteller eine private oder staatliche Initiative / Projekt ist (Schule, Waisenhaus, Jugend-/Flüchtlingsprojekt). Die IT-Spenden können nicht an Einzelpersonen, sondern nur an Projekte gegeben werden, in deren Eigentum die IT-Spenden auch verbleiben. Die IT-Spenden sind gekennzeichnet und nummeriert. Daher ist jederzeit eine Kontrolle möglich, ob die erhaltenen IT-Spenden auch dort noch im Einsatz sind. Eine Weitergabe an Dritte ist nicht erlaubt.

Defekte IT-Spenden werden nur gegen Rückgabe der nicht mehr funktionierenden Geräte kostenlos ausgetauscht.

Eine Projektpräsentation finden Sie auf http://ftp.labdoo.org/download/documents/german/Unterlagen/labdoo-projec....

Für Projekte im Inland:
Projekte im Inland können eine PC-Spende beantragen oder selber aktiv werden, IT-Spenden sammeln und aufbereiten. Bei ca. 23 Mio. ausrangierten Computern in Privathaushalten plus den in Firmen ist der Pool riesig. Die Lernsoftware, Lerninhalte und Deutschkurse können leicht installiert und on- wie offline eingesetzt werden. Falls im Inland Laptops benötigt werden, brauchen wir eine kurze Begründung, warum keine PCs möglich sind.

Für Projekte im Ausland:
Auslandsprojekte erhalten i.d.R. Laptops. Wichtig für eine Entscheidung, ob ein Antrag angenommen wird, ist die Logistik, z.B. ob es Flugpaten gibt, die ab und zu das Projekt besuchen und IT-Spenden nach $SOLICITORCOUNTRYNAME mitnehmen können oder ob es Hilfsendungen gibt, bei denen IT-Spenden als Beipack mitgegeben werden können.

Bitte sagen Sie ca. 4 Wochen vor Abreise Bescheid, damit wir genügend Vorlauf haben, die IT-Spenden vorzubereiten und dem Flugpaten zuzusenden.

Wir können natürlich nur das weitergeben, was uns vorher gespendet wurde. Daher können wir auch nicht sagen, wann die IT-Spenden zusammengekommen sind. Sie können aber mithelfen, indem Sie z.B. ihr Netzwerk informieren selbst und zu IT-Spenden aufrufen oder die Presse informieren und einen Aufruf starten. Grafiken und Logos finden Sie auf http://www.labdoo.org/de/content/faq-forum#FAQ02.

Bei Fragen stehe ich gerne zur Verfügung.

Lieber Antragsteller, liebe(r) $SOLICITORNAME,

Vielen Dank für Ihre Kontaktaufnahme und Ihre Anfrage. Labdoo.org ist eine gemeinnützige Organisation, die IT-Spenden nur an private oder öffentliche Institutionen (Schulen, Waisenhäuser, Flüchtlings-/Bildungsprojekte u.a.) vermittelt. Eine Weitergabe von IT-Spenden an Einzelpersonen ist uns nicht möglich.

Daher können wir Ihrer Anfrage leider nicht entsprechen. Wenn Sie einen Antrag für ein Projekt gemäß unseren Statuten einreichen möchten, melden Sie sich gerne erneut. So kann z.B. eine Schule einen Antrag stellen und dann IT-Spenden für eine gewisse Zeit an SchülerInnen ausleihen. Gerne prüfen wir gemeinsam mit Ihnen Möglichkeiten zu helfen.

Ansonsten kann ich Ihnen nur den Hinweis geben, dass es viele Millionen nicht mehr genutzte Computer in Privathaushalten gibt. Nutzen Sie ihr Netzwerk und fragen Sie im privaten oder beruflichen Umfeld nach ausgemusterten Computern, die man Ihnen vielleicht spenden kann.

Dear $DONORNAME,

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Labdoo.org cause.

In order to make your contribution, you can bring your laptop(s) to your nearest hub where it will be sanitized and installed with the education software making it ready to travel to a destination school. You will find the global list of Labdoo hubs where you can bring your laptop in the following link: https://platform.labdoo.org/content/hubs-dashboard?search=open

If you want to receive automatic emails of the status of your laptop as it makes progress to a destination school as well as pictures of the school once your laptop mini-mission is completed, you can do one of the following two options:

Tag the laptop by creating an account at Labdoo.org and by following the instructions in this form: https://platform.labdoo.org/node/add/laptop
While we encourage the first option, alternatively you can also attach a post-it to the laptop with your email address. The next person in the chain will tag the laptop and include your email address so that you can receive updates.
If you want to contribute even more to help spread education, you can also sanitize your laptop prior to bringing it to a hub. To sanitize a laptop, follow the steps described in this page: https://platform.labdoo.org/content/sanitation-guide-step-step-installat.... This step is only optional, if you don't want to sanitize the laptop, then you can simply bring it to your closest hub and the Labdoo team there will sanitize it for you.

For any additional questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this email and ask me.

Thank you once again for your contribution.

Best regards,

Response to Tax Receipt Request

Dear $DONORNAME,

Thank you for helping to give children a better education with your laptops.

As you may know, Labdoo runs as a distributed / humanitarian social network platform. The donation process propagates from one volunteer to the next, until the laptop reaches its school destination. Our system provides a communication platform for volunteers across more than 100 nations and financial boundaries. Labdoo does not need monetary donations to sustain itself thanks to our collaborative approach. Our no-money approach also implies that there is no chance of financial corruption. With over $CURRENT_NUMBER_OF_LABDOO_LAPTOPS laptops delivered to $CURRENT_NUMBER_LABDOO_SCHOOLS different schools, this model demonstrates the efficacy of running an organization just through collaboration and without the need for funding.

Because of the above reason, Labdoo does not issue tax receipts. By registering your laptops in the Labdoo system, you can be assured that the working laptops are properly delivered via the platform-generated email notification that you receive from the recipient schools, which you can use as proof of your donation to that school. You will also receive email notifications on the status of broken laptops as they make their way to the recycling facility.

Thanks for your understanding and for your joint effort in making the Labdoo system transparent and efficient.

Best regards,

$MYNAME

Dear SOLICITORNAME,

I apologize for the inconvenience created by the laptops not arriving in time for your needs.

Despite our best efforts to deliver the laptops on time, our reliance on factors beyond our control (such as the service provided by the courier, flight schedules, etc.) meant that we were unable to meet your expectations for delivery in the time period allotted.

We are sorry that your plans have been disrupted and we will work with you to determine next steps so that we can resolve the issue together. Furthermore, we will assess the situation to deduce measures we can adopt to help minimize issues of this nature in the future.

Thank you for your understanding.

When solicitors send us a request for laptops for a school in a country COUNTRY_DESTINATION, the first response is to ask back if they know of travelers from any country COUNTRY_SOURCE where Labdoo has hubs (see the Labdoo response to laptop solicitors: https://www.labdoo.org/content/response-dootronics-solicitation). If the solicitors find travelers from a country COUNTRY_SOURCE which has Labdoo hubs, then the next step is to ask them to forward their own request to the Labdoo hubs in country COUNTRY_SOURCE. Here is Labdoo's standard response to help forward solicitors' request to the right country:

English
Hi $NAMEOFSOLICITOR,

That's good news. Since you found traveler(s) from a region where we have Labdoo hubs, please do the following:

(1) Go to https://www.labdoo.org/ and click on "Request Laptops" button. This will take you to this page:

https://platform.labdoo.org/content/contact-labdoo?re=3

(2) Fill in your information, you can copy and paste the original message you sent me. Please tell them also that you have a traveler that can help bring the laptops. Most important, please make sure you select $COUNTRY in the Country field. This will ensure your request will be routed to Labdoo hubs from this country.

Upon doing this, someone from Labdoo $COUNTRY will be reaching back to you.

Wishing you best of luck in finding travelers and Labdoo hubs that can help bring educational laptops to your shool.

Informative Message to Your Regional Hubs

From time to time, it is a good habit to send out an email to hubs in your area reminding them about the Labdoo tools that are available to help organize their laptop campaigns and sanitation events. For instance, for school hubs this message can be send out around early September as their yearly coursework starts. For other hubs (company, NGO, or home hubs) this message can be sent out anytime.

In this page you will find templates for such type of message in various languages that you can re-use for your convenience.

The world buys every year more than 400 million laptops and electronic tablets, yet 5000 million people still don't have access to powerful online and free sources of education. Whether we have 5 minutes, one hour, or a day of our time, here are a few things we can all do together or on our own to help spread education around the world:

Tag a laptop. Do you have a laptop or a tablet that you no longer use? Then consider donating it to a Labdoo school to help bring education to a child. All you need to do is 'tag it' by going to the this link and filling in the form. This will only take you 5 minutes.
Sanitize a laptop. Do you have one hour of your time? then help sanitize a laptop by cleaning an unused laptop or tablet, installing the education software, and making it ready so that the laptop can travel to a needy school. Follow the step by step instructions in the Labdoo wiki to sanitize your unused laptop from this link: sanitation steps.
Help carry a laptop in your next trip. Are you traveling? then consider bringing one or two sanitized laptops/tablets in your luggage to your destination. By re-purposing your trip to help move laptops around the globe, at Labdoo we accomplish our mission of spreading education to schools without adding any new CO2 emissions to the Planet and without any economic cost. We call this collaborative way of transporting objects around the world 'dootrips'. Here is a list of Labdoo hubs from where you can pick up sanitized laptops, and here is a list of target school destinations where they can be delivered. You can register your dootrip by going to this link.
Rescue and recycle a broken laptop. It is as important to spread education using laptops as making sure we keep our planet clean from electronic waste. Do you know of a laptop that is broken and that it can no longer be fixed nor used for education purposes? then it is time to recycle it! Find the closest recycling facility to your place and bring the laptop so its components can be properly disposed, starting a new cycle of life.
Don't forget to register your dootrips. This is very important because: (1) it allows volunteers and helpers to know when the laptops need to be ready to be transported as well as to know how many laptops can be carried; (2) it allows schools to know when the laptops are scheduled for their arrival, and (3) it allows Labdoo to compute the amount of CO2 savings derived from re-purposing a trip and to keep a historical record. The rule of thumb is simple: every time a laptop travels to a destination school, you should register a dootrip. Find all you need to know about dootrips (including how to register them) from this page.
Create your own hub. If you have not done so already and if you have more time and determination to help children reach education, you can also create your own Labdoo hub. Labdoo hubs can be created at home, at work, at high schools, at universities, at your NGO, you name it. The idea is simple: with your own hub, you will be able to create your own local campaigns to collect unused laptops and to host your own laptop sanitation events. If you are interested in creating a hub, email Labdoo at contact@labdoo.org.
Keep your hub semaphore up to date The hub semaphore allows hub managers to announce whether their hub is currently active (accepting laptops and/or performing sanitation tasks), temporarily inactive (e.g. for vacation reasons) or closed. Don't forget to keep your semaphore up to date. You can find more information about hub semaphores from this page.
Communicate with other Labdooers using Team Walls. Using email is good, but we encourage all of you to use the Labdoo Team Walls to communicate as much as possible. Walls are a great way to share information and communicate because they allow all of us to openly see the conversations that are going on, and they also provide a historical record of all the conversations which is very useful to help build the knowledge base. Using the Team Walls is very simple, read these wiki pages to learn how.
Do you own or work for a company? check out Labdoo's CSR package. Companies can play a key role when it comes to helping those that are most in need. If you own or work for a corporation, consider helping the cause of spreading education around the globe by implementing one of the modules described in the Labdoo Corporate Social Responsibility Package.
Help to translate the Labdoo.org social network to other languages. The goal of Labdoo is to break barriers so that education can reach out to all the regions of the world. A key to overcoming these barriers is the capability to write documents and tools in as many languages as possible. Whether you have just 5 minutes, 1 hour, or more time, you can help the platform by contributing a translation. Even if you only have a little bit of time, you can still help with the translation of a small portion, as the sum of many little efforts can make a big difference. Everything counts when it comes to spreading education. If you are interested, contact the Labdoo Team at contact@labdoo.org. See also the Translations Brochure.
Help spread the word. Even if you can't do any of the above, there is still a lot of people in the world who can. So a great way to help spread education is by explaining the Labdoo story to your friends, family, class mates, or co-workers. You can read the About Labdoo page and you can watch this video to learn how the Labdoo Aid Social Network works and to get an idea of how together we can help make Education a universal right. You can also create your own local campaigns to spread awareness and mobilize your local community by using the material (logos, flyers, posters, etc.) that you will find in the Labdoo Toolkit.

Suntem foarte bucuroși că am avem oportunitatea de a contribui la realizarea proiectului dvs, furnizându-vă tehnologia necesară reducerii decalajului digital și informatic în zona dvs. de interes.

Orice beneficiu implică însă și o responsabilitate. Tehnologia, atunci cand este folosită corespunzător, poate reprezenta un mijloc foarte eficient de a-i ajuta pe cei care au într-adevar nevoie.

1.3. Articolele donate pot fi înstrăinate din instituțiile școlare doar cu acordul Labdoo (de exemplu, profesorii nu dreptul de a scoate calculatoarele în afara școlii, fără a înștiința Labdoo în prealabil). Dacă un inspector Labdoo va vizita proiectul dvs. și va constata lipsa unor articole donate, școala și/sau proiectul dvs. vor fi excluse din programul Labdoo și nu vor mai putea primi nici un fel de donații din partea Labdoo

2. În cazul unui incident al oricăruia dintre articolele primite, veți contacta echipa Labdoo la contact@labdoo.org, incluzând în mesajulul dvs. numărul de înregistrare al articolului Labdoo și o scurtă descriere a problemei apărute. Următoarele evenimente vor fi întodeauna raportate:
2.1. Sfârșitul duratei de viață al articolului primit, pentru a putea fi reciclat corespunzător
2.2. Când produsul a suferit distrugeri, defecțiuni, o alterare a stării sale normale de funcționare sau în cazul oricărei schimbări a stării sale inițiale

3. La fiecare 6 luni, veți trimite un E-mail pe adresa contact@labdoo.org, atașând lista calculatoarelor și starea lor (funcțional sau nefuncțional)

4. Calculatoarele Labdoo sunt oferite în mod gratuit în scopuri educaționale. Sunteți de acord să nu le folosiți în scopuri comerciale și să nu solicitati nici o taxă pentru folosul acestora
4.1. Articolele primite nu pot fi revândute, și nici oferite în schimbul altor foloase materiale
4.2. Dacă se va constata lipsa unor articole donate, fără respectarea termenelor și condițiilor, școala și/sau proiectul dvs. vor fi excluse din programul Labdoo și nu vor mai putea primi nici un fel de donații din partea Labdoo

5. Prin completarea și trimiterea acestui formular, solicitantul confirmă deținerea drepturilor asupra tuturor materialelor, prezente sau viitoare, trimise către Labdoo.org, precum și dreptul Labdoo de a folosi aceste materiale în mod public. De asemenea, solicitantul confirmă că a cerut și primit dreptul părinților sau a tutorelui legal, după caz, pentru a fotografia copiii și/sau alți beneficiari ai articolelor donate de către Labdoo. Labdoo.org atrage atenția în mod explicit asupra faptului că materialele trimise, inclusiv fotografiile, pot fi utilizate atât online (internet), cât și offline (materiale printate), pentru a păstra transparența și responsabilitatea acestor proiecte, și prin urmare, materialele, inclusiv fotografiile, pot fi accesate de către terțe părți.

Vă mulțumim pentru implicarea în acțiunile noastre, și pentru implicarea dvs. de a face lumea noastră un loc mai bun, și vă dorim mult succes în realizare proiectelor dvs.

Sample Outreach Letters for School Hubs
Tags: 
outreach
In this page you will find several examples of letters written by high school students. These sample letters are used to make the calls to collect unused laptops and tablets from parents, relatives and friends. The letters are sent to the parents via the school's mailing system. Upon receiving the letter, parents bring their unused laptops to the school. Then the students organize a workshop to sanitize the laptops and install the education software, making them ready for other needy schools. If you have other sample letters (in any language) and would like to share them, please add them to the bottom of this page.

If you are looking for travelers that go from one city to another to help bring one or more laptops (we call this a dootrip), you can reuse this template to send out an email, text it or post it in your favorite social network to find travelers that might be willing to help out.

English

Dear friends,

As many of you already know, I collaborate with Labdoo, the NGO that brings clean unused computers and educational software to schools where they need them, using sustainable resources (and without the need for money) based on the work and collaboration of volunteers around the world. To solve the transportation problem, we repurpose the trips made by people like you, so we do not divert resources that should go to more important things and so that we can help to reduce CO2 emissions to the planet.

To bring computers to [FINAL DESTINATION] we have a traveler that often goes from [INTERMEDIATE POINT], so now we only need to carry laptops from [OUTPUT POINT] in [INTERMEDIATE POINT]. The first trip will do so soon, within a week or so.

If you are planning a trip to [INTERMEDIATE POINT], could you help us with one or two healthy laptops?
(Or if you know someone who is going to)

Here you will find information and pictures of the [FINAL DESTINATION] school, which suffered the terrible effects of the [Pam Cyclone in March 2015 and that is already enough to receive the computers]. (PERSONALIZE AS YOU CONSIDER TIMELY)

Aneu a [DESTINACIÓ FINAL]?

Hola amics,

Com potser sabeu col.laboro amb Labdoo per portar ordinadors en desús sanejats i amb software educatiu a escoles on els necessiten, tot amb recursos sostenibles existents, sense diners. El transport el fem aprofitant viatges de gent com ara vosaltres, així no desviem recursos que han d'anar a coses més importants com la salut.

Per portar ordinadors a [DESTINACIÓ FINAL] tenim un viatger que hi va sovint des de [PUNT INTERMEDI], així que ara sols ens cal portar portàtils de [PUNT DE SORTIDA] a [PUNT INTERMEDI].
El primer viatge el farà aviat, d'aquí una setmana aproximadament, però també hi va sovint.

Si aneu cap a [PUNT INTERMEDI] ens podreu portar un o dos portàtils sanejats i amb software educatiu?
(o si coneixeu algú que hi va)

Aquí trobareu info i fotos de l'escola de [DESTINACIÓ FINAL], que va patir els terribles efectes del [cycló Pam al març del 2015 i que ja està suficientment refeta per rebre els ordinadors]. (PERSONALITZEU COM CONSIDEREU OPORTÚ)

Queridos amigos,

Como muchos ya sabéis colaboro con Labdoo, la ONG que llevar ordenadores en desuso saneados y con software educativo a escuelas donde los necesitan, para esto se aprovechan recursos ociosos, es decir sin dinero, a base del trabajo y colaboración de voluntarios. El transporte por ejemplo lo hacemos aprovechando viajes de gente como vosotros, así no desviamos recursos que deben ir a cosas más importantes como la salud.

Para llevar ordenadores a [DESTINO FINAL] tenemos un viajero que va a menudo desde [PUNTO INTERMEDIO], así que ahora sólo necesitamos llevar portátiles de [PUNTO DE SALIDA] en [PUNTO INTERMEDIO]. El primer viaje lo hará pronto, dentro de una semana aproximadamente.

Si tienes previsto un viaje a [PUNTO INTERMEDIO] ¿podrías ayudarnos llevando uno o dos portátiles saneados?
(O si conoce a alguien que va a )

Aquí encontrarás información y fotos de la escuela de [DESTINO FINAL], que sufrió los terribles efectos del [Ciclón Pam en marzo de 2015 y que ya está suficientemente repuesta para recibir los ordenadores]. (PERSONALICE COMO CONSIDERA OPORTUNO)

Dear $NAME:

Thank you for contacting Labdoo and for all the work you've done to help spread education.

In order to evaluate if we can help your project, we need first to have some more information about your school: could you please tell us more about your project? What are your goals? What are you going to do with the laptops? How many teachers and pupils do you have? How do you plan to train your teachers? How will you maintain your laptops?

If you have a website, could you send it to us? Any pictures?

Please also send us the certificate of registration of your school or non-profit organization.

If you have any further questions please get back to us. Thank you and best wishes,

data deletion
Dear $DONORNAME,

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Labdoo.org cause.

At Labdoo, we want to ensure all data stored in every donated computer is properly erased. Erasing data on the computer hard drive is the required first step in the standard Labdoo laptop sanitation process. Volunteers shall erase data with the “shred” command before installing the new Ubuntu operating system.

Please visit the Labdoo website for detailed information on how to erase data from the computer hard drive ( https://platform.labdoo.org/content/delete-all-data-hard-disk )

Thank you for helping us spread the Labdoo awareness so more used laptops can have a second meaningful life before fully retired.

Sincerely,

$YOURNAME

Labdoo Student Diary
In addition to the guidelines described in the Labdoo School Hub Booklet, it is often suggested by teachers that students performing Labdoo activities take the initiative of writing a report or a diary of their activities. This allows students to enhance their writing and communication skills while at the same time they share their social activities and their learning lessons with the rest of the classmates and the local community.

Here is a great example of a diary that one of the high school students from one of the Labdoo School Hubs wrote and that you can use as a reference example:

Things You Can Do To Spread Education
Tags: 
outreach


The world buys every year more than 400 million laptops and electronic tablets, yet 5000 million people still don't have access to powerful online and free sources of education. Whether we have 5 minutes, one hour, or a day of our time, here are a few things we can all do together or on our own to help spread education around the world:

Tag a laptop. Do you have a laptop or a tablet that you no longer use? Consider donating it to a Labdoo school to help bring education to a child. All you need to do is 'tag it' by going to the this link and filling in the form to register your donated laptop. Then contact your closest Labdoo Hub and bring your laptop there so it can be sanitized and installed with education packages. Tagging a laptop will only take you 5 minutes, but if you don't have that time, then simply drop your laptop at your closest Labdoo Hub and a Labdoo volunteer will tag it for you!
Help carry a laptop in your next trip. Are you traveling? then consider bringing one or two sanitized laptops/tablets in your luggage to your destination. By re-purposing your trip to help move laptops around the globe, at Labdoo we accomplish our mission of spreading education to schools without adding any new CO2 emissions to the Planet and without any economic cost. We call this collaborative way of transporting objects around the world 'dootrips'. Here is a list of Labdoo hubs from where you can pick up sanitized laptops, and here is a list of target school destinations where they can be delivered. You can register your dootrip by going to this link.
Help spread the word. A great way to help spread the Labdoo awareness is to explain the Labdoo story to your friends, family, class mates, or co-workers. You can read the About Labdoo page and you can watch this video to learn how the Labdoo Aid Social Network works and to get an idea of how together we can help make Education a universal right. You can also create your own local campaigns to spread awareness and mobilize your local community by using the material (logos, flyers, posters, etc.) that you will find in the Labdoo Toolkit. Lastly, you can share the journey of your 'dootrips' (delivering the laptops to local schools or 'edoovillage') through your social media like Instagram - follow and tag @labdoo_org in Instagram!
Do you own or work for a company? Check out Labdoo's CSR package. Companies can play a key role when it comes to helping those that are most in need. If you own or work for a corporation, consider helping the cause of spreading education around the globe by implementing one of the modules described in the Labdoo Corporate Social Responsibility Package.
Create your own hub. If you have more time and the determination to help children reach education, you can also create your own Labdoo hub. Labdoo hubs can be created at home, at work, at high schools, at universities, at your NGO, you name it. The idea is simple: with your own hub, you will be able to create your own local campaigns to collect unused laptops and to host your own laptop sanitation events. If you are interested in creating a hub, email Labdoo at contact@labdoo.org.
Rescue and recycle a broken laptop. It is as important to help education by using laptops as to keep our planet clean from electronic waste. Do you know of a laptop that is broken and can no longer be fixed, nor be used for educational purposes? Then it is time to recycle it! Find the closest recycling facility to your place and bring the laptop so its components can be properly disposed, starting a new cycle of life.
Help translate the Labdoo.org social network into other languages. The goal of Labdoo is to break barriers so that education can reach out to every corner of the world. A key to overcoming these barriers is the capability to write documents and tools in as many languages as possible. Whether you have just 5 minutes, 1 hour, or more time, you can help the platform by contributing a translation. Even if you only have a little bit of time, you can still help with the translation of a small portion, as the sum of many little efforts can make a big difference. Everything counts when it comes to spreading education. If you are interested, contact the Labdoo Team at contact@labdoo.org. See also the Translations Brochure.
