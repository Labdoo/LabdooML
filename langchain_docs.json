Here\u2019s a detailed summary:\n\n**Collecting Unused Laptops:**\n- Volunteers are encouraged to identify unused laptops through family, neighbors, company IT departments, and social media.\n- Acceptable laptops must have at least 1GB RAM and be functional, even with non-working batteries. The AC adapter and power cord should also be collected.\n\n**Tagging a Laptop:**\n- Collected laptops must be registered on the Labdoo platform to receive a unique Labdoo ID for tracking.\n- The tagging process involves creating an account, accessing the \"Dootronics\" menu, filling out the tagging form, and attaching printed tags to the laptop.\n\n**Sanitizing a Laptop:**\n- Volunteers learn to sanitize laptops and install Labdoo's educational package using Labtix, a bootable USB tool.\n- Instructions for creating a Labtix Bootable USB include downloading Labtix.iso, installing FileZilla FTP client, and connecting to the Labdoo FTP server.\n\n**Project Coordination:**\n- Before contributing a laptop, volunteers should check for existing projects in their area and contact them if additional laptops are needed.\n- If no projects are nearby, volunteers can reach out to local schools or mentoring associations to establish a project with Labdoo\u2019s assistance.\n\n**Technical Aspects:**\n- Modern smartphones can create WiFi networks, but compatibility depends on the laptop's WiFi chip. Instructions for setting up laptops as WiFi hotspots are provided.\n- During Lubuntu installation, a \"labdoo\" user is created for teachers, and a \"student\" user is automatically created with limited rights.\n\n**Sanitizing Smartphones:**\n- The Labdoo Smartphone Program aims to connect disadvantaged students to education through donated smartphones, requiring them to be in good condition and running Android 5 or higher.\n- The sanitation process includes tagging, ensuring encryption, and performing factory resets.\n\n**Labdoo Toolkit:**\n- Tools for conducting mini-missions, including flyers and presentation slides, are available under a Creative Commons License.\n- Email templates for standard responses to various requests are provided to ensure communication consistency.\n\n**Donation Process:**\n- To donate laptops, volunteers can either tag the device through the Labdoo platform or attach a note with their email for updates.\n- Laptops must be functional and have a minimum of 1000MB RAM. They can be sanitized by volunteers or brought directly to a hub for Labdoo's team to handle.\n\n**Traveler Assistance:**\n- Travelers can assist by carrying laptops to schools in need, with instructions to register their trips (dootrips) in advance.\n- Volunteers are encouraged to rescue and recycle broken laptops responsibly.\n\n**Communication and Outreach:**\n- Volunteers can create their own hubs for collecting laptops and hosting sanitation events.\n- Labdoo encourages spreading awareness and translating materials to enhance global education access.\n\n**Data Deletion Assurance:**\n- Labdoo ensures all data on donated laptops is erased during the sanitation process, using the \u201cshred\u201d command before installing new operating systems.\n\nOverall, the document serves as a detailed guide for Labdoo volunteers, outlining the essential steps for collecting, sanitizing, and delivering laptops and smartphones to support educational initiatives worldwide.", "metadata": {}}, {"content": "The document provides detailed instructions on connecting to the Labdoo FTP server, downloading the Labtix.iso file, and creating a bootable USB for installation. To download Labtix.iso, users should use FileZilla to access the /install-disk folder on the Labdoo FTP server. For creating a bootable USB, the Universal USB Installer is recommended, requiring a blank USB pendrive of at least 2GB. Users must select the Labtix.iso file and the USB drive within the installer to complete the process.\n\nFor downloading Labdoo images, an external hard drive with a minimum capacity of 100GB should be connected to the Labdoo FTP server. Users can navigate to language-specific directories (e.g., EN_English_images) and download the desired image directory, such as PAE64_20_04_LTS_EN_160, with download times varying based on connection speed.\n\nTo install the Labdoo image using Labtix, users should insert the bootable USB into the target computer and ensure it boots from the USB. If necessary, the boot order must be modified. Upon booting, users select \"antiX\" and double-click the 'Labdoo installer' icon, where key laptop parameters (version, CPU type, boot device, RAM, and hard drive size) are displayed. Users must confirm the hard drive name and specify parameters for the installation, including the number of times to shred the hard disk (recommended: 3), target disk name, disk size, image selection, and hostname format (labdoo-XXXXXXXXX). After confirming parameters, users click \"OK\" to initiate the shredding and installation process, which can take over an hour.\n\nLabtix 2, launched in 2022, is the latest installer and remover tool for the Labdoo project, replacing Labtix 1, which was based on a 32-bit Antix 17 kernel. Labtix 2 uses a 64-bit Antix 21 kernel, supporting modern hardware and requiring cloning images of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or higher due to a new boot partition format incompatible with earlier versions. It mandates a minimum of a 2GB USB key or DVD for installation and requires a computer with at least 1.5-2GB RAM. The user interface has been minimally altered for ease of use, with mandatory updates including the integration of the zzzFM file manager.\n\nLabtix 2 supports both legacy and UEFI installations through a hybrid installer, automating UEFI processes and requiring the UEFI image on the installation medium. Labdoo has streamlined storage and management by opting for a single set of legacy images with UEFI support. \n\nUser support and tools have been improved, including battery capacity indicators, enhanced SSD support, and new drivers for current hardware. Additional tools like Speaker test, Live USB Maker, Avahi network scan, StressCPU, and DiskCheck are included. Cloning images based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS were uploaded to the FTP in mid-2022, while older versions (20.04 LTS and 18.04 LTS) have been archived or removed due to capacity issues. Starting summer 2023, only small \"BASIC\" images will be used, with larger images phased out.\n\nLabtix 1, which is no longer developed, was based on Antix 17 and supported both 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs, optimized for older hardware. It required a minimum of a 2GB USB stick or CD and 1GB RAM for installation.\n\nFor UEFI/BIOS settings, Secure Boot must be disabled, and TPM should remain enabled unless it prevents booting. UEFI should be disabled for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS installations, with a dual installation concept for 22.04 LTS. SuperGrub2Disk can be used for boot issues, and Turbo Boost may need to be disabled to prevent overheating.\n\nBefore installing a donated computer, thorough hardware checks are essential. Recommended checks include evaluating the hard drive with GSmart/DiskCheck, monitoring CPU temperatures with StressCpu/psensor, inspecting the cooling system, and testing speaker functionality.\n\nLabtix provides tools for deleting old data and automating OS installations, along with diagnostic tools for hardware issues. ISO files can be downloaded from the FTP server, and checksums should be used to verify downloads. Users must create boot media correctly using tools like Rufus for Windows, Live USB Maker for Linux, or balenaEtcher for macOS.\n\nTo determine the best image and content for installation, users should consider CPU architecture, target language, and hard disk size. BASIC images are named according to their Ubuntu version and are available in multiple languages. Additional learning content must be stored locally, as downloading during installation is not supported.\n\nLabtix updates include the introduction of new control files for content installation, reducing redundancy. Users can create and share custom control files for specific installations. The document also outlines steps for mounting drives, connecting to the network, and installing images using Labtix.\n\nFinally, the document summarizes various applications available in Labtix, including tools for screen configuration, audio testing, network scanning, and system information. It provides commands for package management, disk operations, and system monitoring, emphasizing the transition from Labtix 1 to Labtix 2 for improved functionality and support.", "metadata": {}}, {"content": "The document outlines the requirements and procedures for installing and using Labtix 2.09 or higher, which is essential for setting up educational content on Labdoo systems.
